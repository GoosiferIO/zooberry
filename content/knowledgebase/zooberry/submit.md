Thank you for your interest in submitting your file for hosting on ZooBerry. Since ZooBerry is a [statically-generated website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator), we don't have a traditional means of submission. There are no user accounts, nor is there a way to upload files directly to the site. Please follow the steps ahead to submit your file.

# Submit by Email

Feel free to attach any files to the email. If you have multiple files, please consider compressing them into a single archive file (e.g., .zip, .7z). Descriptions for each file (if necessary) can be included in the email body.
