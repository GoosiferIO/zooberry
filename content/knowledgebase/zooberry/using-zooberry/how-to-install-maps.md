# Getting Started

## Zoo Tycoon 1

## Installing Zoos

`.zoo` files are the Zoo Tycoon 1 save file format and is used for both the zoo maps themselves after saving the game and for scenarios.

To install a zoo save file, drop it into the following directory:

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon\Saved Games`

## Installing Scenarios

If you happen to have a copy of one of the few custom scenarios and wish to install it, simply drop the `.zoo` file in the following directory. Any accompanying `.ztd` and lang files are installed the same as explained above.

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon\Maps`

## Zoo Tycoon 2

## Installing Zoos and Maps

Zoos and maps are essentially save files and will go into the save folder. Open up a File Explorer on Windows and enter the following line into the address bar:

`%appdata%`

This will convert into a proper file-system address that will have several folders named after applications installed on your computer. From here, go to the following path:

`Microsoft Games > Zoo Tycoon 2 > Default Profile > Saved`

This is where you will drop your `.z2f` save file.
