# Frequently Asked Questions

## What websites are being archived by ZooBerry?

Originally the scope was just three websites, including ZooMania, Northern Skies, and Artifex. However, we had the privelege of getting permission to host mods from other websites as well.

The current list of websites whose mods and tutorials we are committed to archiving are as follows:

- ZooMania
- Northern Skies
- Artifex
- ZT2 Designing Centre
- Penguika
- Penguin's Peak
- Shen's Den
- Zoo Tycoon Hideout
- Zoo Tycoon Volcano
- Z-Studio
- Bunyupy's Projects
- Hispa Designs
- Dannybob's Forum
- Stalker's Ranch
- ZooTek Phoenix (Zoo Tycoon 2 Library)
- Zoo Admin (Zoo Tycoon 2 Library)

## How did you get permission to host mods from these websites?

Luckily a few members that either owned, were core members of design teams, or were the original authors of mods hosted on these websites were still around and were able to give us permission to host their mods. In some cases, we were able to get permission from the website owner to take over stewardship of mods hosted on their website. 

Below is a list of individuals and their relation to the websites whose mods we are hosting:

| Websites | Individual | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZooMania, Northern Skies, Artifex | Goosifer | Team Member, Co-Owner, Co-Founder |
| ZT2 Designing Centre, Artifex, Penguika, Penguin's Peak | Penguinman | Co-Founder, Team Member, Co-Owner |
| Shen's Den, Artifex | ShenTirag | Owner, Team Member |
| ZooMania, Artifex | Koala Komander | Founder, Co-Owner, Team Member |
| Zoo Tycoon Volcano | Incinerox | Owner |
| Zoo Tycoon Hideout, ZT2 Designing Centre | JohnZTMaster | Owner, Founder, Co-Owner |

*Note: roles in parantheses are not in any particular order.*

### Individual Modders

These individuals are not associated with any particular website, but have given us permission to host their mod libraries or in some cases individual mods:

- Harlequinz eg0 (Certain mods)
- Hendrix (Permission to archive mods from his Drive)
- Hawkkeye666 (Permission to archive mods from his Drive)
- Lgcfm (Certain mods)

## I'm a current Zoo Tycoon modder. May I submit files to ZooBerry for hosting?

Absolutely. Although mod archival is the main motivation behind ZooBerry's creation, we host mods for current teams and modders as well. Please check out the [Submit a File](/knowledgebase/zooberry/site/submit) page for more information.

## What is your stance on mod ownership?

The original authors for mods hosted on ZooBerry have long moved on and are no longer in the Zoo Tycoon modding community. Whenever possible we have made effort to contact modders that are still around for permission to host their libraries, but when not available we contact the website owner that hosts their mods for permission to take over stewardship if the owner thinks it makes sense. (i.e. if file links are starting to break)

ZooBerry believes in mod ownership and therefore if you are an author to a mod hosted here on ZooBerry and wish to have it taken down, please message us at zooberry@goosifer.io.

## Do you have a forum?

We used to, but it's quite expensive and frankly they're just not as popular as they used to be. Since ZooBerry is one of our main projects at OpenZT, you are welcome to communicate with us on the [OpenZT Discord](https://discord.gg/ATqFYVsjkc).

For other ZT forum communities around the internet, please see the [Other Websites](/knowledgebase/zooberry/community/other-websites) page.
