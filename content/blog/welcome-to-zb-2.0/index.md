# Welcome to the new ZooBerry!

Over the past few months, we've been working hard to bring you a new and improved ZooBerry experience. We've updated the site to freshen up the look and make it easier to navigate. We've also added new features and content to help you get the most out of your Zoo Tycoon experience. Here's a quick rundown of what's new:

## New Design

We've given the site a fresh coat of paint with a new design that's cleaner and more modern. The new layout makes it easier to find what you're looking for and hopefully offers a better reading experience.

## Contributor Lists

### Team Pages

Not completely unfamiliar to the old site, but we've added a team page to list all design teams and their files. From there you can find brand new design team pages that list all of their mods in one place along with some quick stats.
