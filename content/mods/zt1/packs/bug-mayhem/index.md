Thanks for downloading Bug Mayhem!!!

A little expansion pack containing items for a full terrarium of arthropods!

> 2024 Spring Present. For Cynthia, my mother.

# IMPORTANT NOTE!!!

Items uses Borsato's `ui99ztd` + `LANG--ZBorsato.dll` content! (Available in the link at his signature)
If you don't have it yet and wanna know how it works, you may find it here:

https://zootekphoenix.com/forums/topic/11248-borsato-project/page/21/#comment-317858

However, it will work correctly even if you don't use these patches.

# Content List

## Animals

- Meganeura. Coniferous//Aquatic.
- Pulmonoscorpius. Coniferous forest.

## Foliage

- Archaeopteris. Coniferous forest + Water placeable!

# Compatibility Guide

- The whole pack is compatible with CC.
- Pulmonoscorpius & Meganeura are compatible with *Khaydar's* Arthropleura.
- Pulmonoscorpius & Meganeura like aquatic foliage, meanwhile Arthropleura do not. That's whe Archaeopteris is configured as a water placeable foliage item.
- Compatibility tests show that with at least half of non-aquatic foliage, Arthropleura's suitability will remain above 95. 

# Credits

- Plaque backgrounds made with StableDiffusion algorithm. Texts made with ChatGPT. Follow this thread if you wanna know more: https://zootekphoenix.com/forums/topic/40756-zarawattos-ai-generated-plaques/
- Meganeura & Pulmonoscorpius' sounds from Pokemon (Nintendo, 2024).
- Meganeura & Pulmonoscorpius made using *Ulquiorra's* base animals.
- Archaeopteris made using *Verdant Gregor's* base model.
