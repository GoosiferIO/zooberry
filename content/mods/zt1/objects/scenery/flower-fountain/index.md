Download the Flower Fountain. This object features a continuous stream of water that is pumped out of a four-sided star base centered in a small pool of water surrounded by eight flower beds. This fountain is a must-have for any zoo. It will boost your guests' happiness and will be the highlight of your scenery items.  

I want to say thank you to Casey, who took time to fix the rotations for this object.
