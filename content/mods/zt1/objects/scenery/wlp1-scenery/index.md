Scenery, UCS File fixed, Water placeable, Exhibit placeable(Animals don't feel happy or unhappy)

If you have the old files, delete them and download new files thank you~ :)

If you want them to be shelters, you can try to look for them at "ZooTek Phoenix" site :)

Thanks to hawkmistress for the help
