No, stop, don't leave. Your guests want this hotdog-shaped hotdog stand. Install it. Because, you know, the game is really lacking in those.

Special thanks to Jay and Fern for all of the hand-holding during the development of this mod as I fired off a billion questions. They effectively did the all of the configuration; I just followed directions.

### Alternative Version

For the 'contest mode' version of this mod, please download from the 'alternative' button below. The 'alternative' version makes your guests absolutely fall-over-heels with the stand and will increase your zoo rating immensely. The original version of this mod gives no extra perks in case you're someone who prefers to play with standard vanilla settings.
