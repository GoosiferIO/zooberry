# Credits

The Atlantean Fountain model, animations, and texturing were created by Goosifer. Tools used were Blender, Photoshop, and VS Code.

Special thanks to Jay and @Fernfor all of their configuration help! Don't know that I would get very far in the ZT1 modding scene without them.

Also big thanks to @Vondell for teaching me his Blender process. It's helped loads with the grid alignment.

# Alternative Version

The ‘alternative’ version makes your guests absolutely fall-over-heels with the fountain and will increase your zoo rating immensely and make your guests super happy. The standard version of this mod is designed to have traits close to other fountains similar to it in the vanilla version of the game. 

Alternative = for fun
Standard = still fun, but the standard challenge and no extra perks
