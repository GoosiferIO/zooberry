This language file adds new text strings to Zoo Tycoon 1. It is required for some mods to work properly. This file is created by Borsato and was originally released on on his Google Drive. Because several ZooBerry mods rely on this file and Borsato's Google Drive is no longer available, this file has been archived here because it is an important dependency. If you are the author of this file and would like it removed, please contact us.
