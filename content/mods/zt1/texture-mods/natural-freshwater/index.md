A mod that edits the palette for fresh water tanks and various related graphics to give it a more natural look. Included are new palettes for the fresh water tanks and all the varying stages of murkiness, as well as slight alterations to the surface and edge ripples. The edge ripples are shared between both salt and fresh water tanks and as a result are not edited as drastically as the other palettes. There are minor alterations to the UI buttons for freshwater tanks, as well.
