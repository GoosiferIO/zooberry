>  **Zarawatto**: I honestly don't know what went bad with Ichthyovenator and Amargasaurus... I started this several months ago and now I can't figure out what was wrong with them... Concavenator was complete because it was the first one I crafted. Irritator, on the other hand, was as well irritating for me, but it is finished.
