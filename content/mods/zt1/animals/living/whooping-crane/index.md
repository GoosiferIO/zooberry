The whooping crane (Grus americana) is a strictly protected and monitored bird in the USA and Canada. It is estimated that there were about 1,500 birds in the aspen parkland and prairie regions of Western Canada and the USA in the late 1800's. As human settlement spread westward, the world population was reduced to a low of 15 birds in the 1937 by hunting and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts since 1938 have resulted in a slow increase. There are now 320 whooping cranes world-wide, including those in captivity.

Update: The whooping crane is now compatible with ZTCC. Use langZA01.dll instead of the one in the file.
