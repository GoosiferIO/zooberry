The Patagonian Mara is a unique mammal resembling a mix between a rabbit and a small deer. Native to the arid regions of Argentina, this herbivore is known for its long legs, which allow it to reach remarkable speeds while escaping predators. It thrives in social groups and is a fascinating addition to any zoo's South American exhibit.
