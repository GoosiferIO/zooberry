Parma Wallabies, also known as Macropus parma, can be found hopping around in Eastern New South Wales in Australia. Like all kangaroos, wallaroos, and wallabies, the Parma is a true herbivore, browsing on low vegetation and grazing on grasses. While grazing, a "5-legged" posture is frequently assumed. The animal uses four legs and its tail as it "walks," rather than hops. Its normal gait is hopping, and its hind legs are elongated and heavily muscled, with the tail used for balance when hopping.
