Rhizodus was a genus of giant lobe-finned fish that ruled freshwater ecosystems during the Carboniferous period, approximately 359 to 299 million years ago. Known for its massive size, sharp teeth, and predatory prowess, Rhizodus is a prime example of the evolutionary experimentation that characterized prehistoric aquatic environments. Its fossilized remains offer a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of Earth's most fearsome freshwater predators.
