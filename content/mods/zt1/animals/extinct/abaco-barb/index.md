The Abaco Barb was a rare breed of horse that lived on Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. It was known for its hardiness and small stature, standing between 13 and 14 hands high, with a muscular build. However, the breed went extinct in 2015, and the horses were descendants of Spanish Barbs brought to the Caribbean. They were admired for their resilience and gentle temperament but faced numerous threats to survival before extinction.
