The Titanichthys, an extinct genus of giant placoderm fish, reigned supreme in the oceans during the Late Devonian period, approximately 380–360 million years ago. Known for its massive size and enigmatic features, Titanichthys has intrigued paleontologists and marine enthusiasts alike as one of the largest jawed fish to have ever existed. With an estimated length of up to 30 feet, this colossal creature was a contemporary of the infamous Dunkleosteus, yet it differed greatly in its ecological role and feeding strategy.
