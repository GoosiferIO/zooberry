Onchopristis, a genus of extinct sawfish that lived during the Cretaceous period approximately 145 to 66 million years ago, was a formidable aquatic predator with a distinctive elongated rostrum lined with sharp, serrated teeth. Its impressive size, estimated to be up to 8 meters (26 feet) long, makes it an exciting candidate for inclusion in a Zoo Tycoon.
