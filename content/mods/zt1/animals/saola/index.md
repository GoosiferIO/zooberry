Description 

Adds the rare and elusive Saola for adoption in your zoo. They can be a bit of a pain to keep happy and can be expensive, but they make up for that in guest appeal! Should be compatible with most versions of the game, although their preferred foliage, the Durian tree, was included with the Endangered Species Theme Pack, as well as Complete Collection, so you need either one of these for that to work properly.

 
Credits 

- Original model and textures by KING Art.
- Zoo Tycoon 2 for the rig, animations and sounds.
- Serpyderpy for importing, rigging and editing the model, editing the textures, creating the animal, icons and plaques."


Compatibility


Requires the Endangered Species Theme Pack by Blue Fang or the Complete Collection.
