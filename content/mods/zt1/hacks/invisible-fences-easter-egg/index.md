Invisible Fences Easter Egg


This mod adds a new "easter egg" cheat to the game. Rename a guest to "Mrs. Invis" to make all stick pole fences invisible. Rename a guest to "Mr. Show" to make all stick pole fences visible.


Features


- Fences are indestructible while invisible. They also top off on health and strength every few months to prevent decay.
- Turn invisible fences back on after placement to make changes.
- Other traits while invisible: height of 5 units, not jumpable, not climbable.
 

Considerations


A minor bug exists where if you replace another fence with an invisible fence, then both will turn invisible. Renaming a guest to Mr. Show will only make the stick pole fence visible, not the other one. You can run the bulldozer along the path you remember to delete it. A fix will be patched in a future version.


Installation


1. Requires EMU v1.1.0 to work. EMU download here: https://github.com/openztcc/EMU/releases/latest

2. To install, drop the res-EMU.dll binary directly into your C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon game directory.

3. Create a new folder called `scripts` inside of your main Zoo Tycoon directory. Drop script inside this folder after EMU is installed.

4. Run game.
