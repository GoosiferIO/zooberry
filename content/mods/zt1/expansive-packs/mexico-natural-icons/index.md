Thanks for downloading Mexico Natural Icons Pack!

=(^w^)=

This pack release date was originaly planned to be 22 August 13th, as a remembrance for the 501 years after Fall of Tenochtitlan, but the designing works delayed a bit.
Mexico Natural Icons Pack is the first of the "Works on Lacking Stuff" projects, which includes some items for themed zoos, including the Japanese Garden Souvenir Store (to be released) and other items to be announced.

# Content List

Within this file, you'll find the following items (in single ZTDs and a whole combined one):

## 5 new animals
- Xoloitzcuintle (Canis lupus familiaris), a.k.a. Mexican Hairless Dog. Grassland.
- Cacomistle (Bassariscus sumichrasti), a.k.a. Southern Ringtail Cat. Deciduous Forest.
- Sarahuato (Alouatta palliata mexicana), a.k.a. Mexican Mantled Howler. Rainforest.
- Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno). Rainforest.
- Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). Desert.

## 5 new foliage items:
- Corn Smut Maize (Ustilago maydis). Deciduous Forest.
- Vanilla Orchid Tree (Vanilla planifolia). Rainforest.
- Cocoa Tree (Theobroma cacao). Rainforest.
- Dragon Fruit Cactus Flowerbed (Hylocereus undatus). Decorative.
- Tomato & Jalapeño Chinampa (Solanum lycopersicum + Capsicum annuum). Water placeable.

## 5 new animated scenery items:
- Atlantic Horseshoe (Limulus polyphemus) Sandy Beach.
- Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) Rocky Pond.
- Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus) Dusky Tree.
- Crested Lizard (Basiliscus plumifrons) Cloudy Garden.
- Short Crested Coquette (Lophornis brachylophus) Shiny Shrine.

# Compatibility Guide

- This pack works better with ZTCC as it uses some Bonus Animals sounds, but should run with all versions.

- Xoloitzcuintle is compatible with -Hawkkeye's Good Boys-, which includes the following dog breeds: 
  - Border Collie
  - Dalmatian
  - German Sheperd
  - Golden Retriever
  - Rough Collie
  - Siberian Husky.
 - In addition to Good Boys preferences, and in order to match mexican theme, Xoloitzcuintle also likes desertic foliage and rocks as well. For a solo-xolo exhibit, it's not a problem at all. However, in a multiple dogs exhibit, Good Boys will naturally dislike desertic items, so you shouldn't use them in that case.

- Cacomistle is fully compatible with -Hawkkeye's Virginia Opossum-
- Western Diamondback Rattlesnake is fully compatible with -Hawkkeye's Desert Pack-, which includes the following animals: 
  - Black Tailed Jackrabbit
  - Desert Tortoise
  - Greater Roadrunner

- Sarahuato & Resplendent Quetzal are both compatible with each other & with -Hawkkeye's Collared Peccary & White Nosed Coati-.

- Cacomistle is configured to like Corn Smut Maize as much as its prefered in-game tree (Thornless Mesquite).
- Sarahuato is configured to like Cocoa Tree as much as its prefered in-game tree (Ulmo).
- Resplendent Quetzal is configured to like Vanilla Orchid Tree as much as its prefered in-game tree (Kapok).

- Hawkkeye's stuff is found & available at ZooTek or at the link in his signature.
