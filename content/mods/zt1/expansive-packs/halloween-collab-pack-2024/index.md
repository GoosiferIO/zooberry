# Halloween Collab Pack 2024

Adds some very spooky additions to your zoo, just in time for Halloween! This is a small collaboration pack from a few Zoo Tycoon 1 designers which adds in various items, foliage and animals in order to make your zoo feel a bit more seasonal.

There is the full version of this pack which combines everything you see in the screenshots into one file, and two alternate versions that have split the content into smaller packs if people want to pick and choose.

If you choose the full pack or Serpy's pack you will need the Zookeeper's Lounge lang file in order for the haunted house to have a proper name and tooltip in the UI.

Included in the full pack is:

- Three new animals, the wild boar, the spooky ghost shark and the mysterious Bloop. The wild boar is fully compatible with base Zoo Tycoon, while the ghost shark and the Bloop require Marine Mania. The wild boar is also fully compatible with Taz's red deer!
- Two new foliage pieces, a yellow aspen and a golden aspen to beautify your zoo.
- Two new scenery pieces, a small and large pumpkin for that seasonal flair.
- One new building, a haunted house complete with sounds and animations.

Credits:

- Sims 4 for the meshes for the pumpkins, aspen and haunted house base.
- Rollercoaster Tycoon for the sounds used for the haunted house.
- Hendrix for the wild boar base mesh.
- Major Galah for the Bloop base mesh and texture.
- Hungry Shark Evolution for the ghost shark model and texture.
- Serpyderpy and Buffzoo for converting stuff and making all these things work!

Happy Halloween, and enjoy!
