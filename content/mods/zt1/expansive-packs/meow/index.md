Thanks for downloading **Mischievous Erradicators of Outside Wildlife (M.E.O.W.)**!!!

# This pack has two purposes

## Number One

I'm a cat lover and I will always be. But this pack, most by its own name, is a recall for all cat owners: We all must be responsible cat lovers! Because of this, remember: Neuter and vaccinate your kittens, but most important: Do NOT let them roam outdoors! Cats are an actual threat for ecosystems. This is no unsupported opinion, this is a fact!

## Number Two

Dedicated to my two cat sisters, Vega & Rigel, whose birthday is on September 7th. Also dedicated to all cat lovers! My beloved & I are both cat lovers: Meanwhile she loves sphynx cats, I'd rather wegies, which are the whole opposite. That's why those are the only ones with gender differencies (New version has now Brittish Longhair which also has gender differencies, as suggested by ZZ).
