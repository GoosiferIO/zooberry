First and foremost a huge, huge thank you has to go out to horse14t for buying the beta disc in the first place. We have found so much cool stuff for this series alone thanks to their efforts and it would be wrong not to thank them for their willingness to buy these discs and share them with the rest of the community!!

This pack takes content from the Dinosaur Digs marketing beta and seperates them from their intended retail versions. There are two versions of this pack, one which includes the beta Iguanodon as a seperate animal but still retains all the compatability as the retail Iguanodon, and another version that changes the beta Iguanodon into a Dakotadon. Both versions of this pack contain the new scenery. You can pick one or the other.

Included is:
- Beta Iguanodon fully seperated and added as a new animal, though it is for all intents and purposes the same species as Iguanodon. They are fully compatible terrain wise with maybe a few minor stat differences, and the retail Iguanodon will complain that there are incompatible animals, but you can still reach a high suitability and animal happiness regardless. If you choose the Dakotadon version of this pack, the beta Iguanodon will be renamed that in game, with some terrain changes and appropriate tweaks.
- When the beta Iguanodon escapes and is crated, it will appear inside the larger dinosaur box that was present in the beta.
- Early versions of the Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor skeletons.
- Early versions of the lava pit, tar pit and volcano.
- Three new scenery pieces have been added which use the beta appearence of the insectivore chow, as adding new food at the time of this release is currently not possible.

Credits:
- horse14t for buying the marketing disc in the first place.
- Blue Fang for the beta assets.
- Serpyderpy for isolating all the stuff and seperating them.

Enjoy!

Known issues:

If using the non-Dakotadon version of the pack, selecting the beta Iguanodon and then clicking on the opposite gender icon will select the retail Iguanodon in the menu instead. This is less a bug but more so a consequence of reusing the same name id.
