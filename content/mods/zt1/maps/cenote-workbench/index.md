Meet the Eeke-Ku-Yooko (mayan for "dancing star") cenote.

A place lost in Yucatan rainforest where guests used to gather for a swim and a tasty meal, when suddenly a jaguar came out from the jungle in the evening of October 31st, between Halloween & DÃ­a De Los Muertos.

All customers naturally fled from the park and it's said that the beast, named by local people "Yum Kaax" after mayan woods god, still roams around there.

Your first task is find and place Yum Kaax in a right place where it can be safe, so guests will go back to the cenote.

Then, turn the whole place in a natural area where guests may learn about wildlife! Good luck!

No extra items needed. For ZTCC version.
