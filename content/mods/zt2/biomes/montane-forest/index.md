title: Montane Forest
---
Montane forests are a type of tropical moist forest that exist at higher elevations. In some regions this can cause the formation of a cloud forest, but in most a standard montane forest setting occurs. These forests often have many epiphytes which are plants that can grow without roots because it can get moisture and nutrients from the air.
