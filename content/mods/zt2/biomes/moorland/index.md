title: Moorland
---
Moorland is an upland habitat covered in low lying vegetation, such as hardy grasses and thick carpets of heather. Moorland makes up substantial amounts of the natural ecosystem of the British Isles, as well as extensive parts of East Africa and Central Asia. Seventy-five percent of the world's heather moorland is found in Great Britain, and all moorland features extensive levels of endemism, as the climate and ecosystem is so particular and severe.
