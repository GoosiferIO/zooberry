As some of you might know I live in Adelaide and my Local zoo is the Adelaide zoo, I have altered to zookeepers uniforms, so they have the zoo's logo on it, but with the shrinkage and what have you the word Adelaide got blended in and the wallaby doesn't show up as well as in the screen, but here it is. RND fixed the file to make uniform show up.

# Installation
unzip into
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2\1033`

or if you have my other staff, unzip into
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2\downloads`

then move the 2 files into the Gibbon Fanatic folder

Not compatible with Martin1990's New Vendor Uniform.
