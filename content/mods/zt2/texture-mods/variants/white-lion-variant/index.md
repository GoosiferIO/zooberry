I was asked to say something about my White Lion:  

Well, in short, I wanted to create the White Lion because I fell in love with them as a child. When I was about 7, I saw two White Lion cubs being shown at a hotel in Las Vegas. The two cubs and their trainers were in a large glass case inside the hotel at the entrance, and I was amazed and stunned by their beauty.  

So, when I got Zoo Tycoon 2, I knew that I had to create the White Lion Variant as my first project (though, the tiger ended up being released first ðŸ˜‰).
