Here are three variants for the Giant Panda:

- **White:** A very rare coloring observed in the wild a few times, but not albino.
- **Brown:** Less rare but still uncommon, found mainly in regions with white pandas.
- **All Black:** Extremely rare, never officially documented.  

**Notes:** Works with both males and females.
