"Greets, this is a remake of my first project for ZT2, the dodo reskin, I see the first onw wasn't very well done, so now I decided to do a new gray skin, sustented by a scientific research. Also I decided to keep the original skin for the young. I hope I can continue working with extinct birds the next days. Any suggestion let me know." - Ringo
