Guide by Sideshow Bob with help from Otter Lord and Ranger107.

To help you make ZT2 animals
This tutorial requires downloading the following programs:

WinRAR - An archiving program (like WinZip) to open .z2f files.
WinHex - Necessary to recolor and open nif files.
Microsoft DirectX SDK Summer 2004 Update - This opens the dds, or texture files, and will help to recolor.
