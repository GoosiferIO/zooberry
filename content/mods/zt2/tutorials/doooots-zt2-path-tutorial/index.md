summary: "How to make paths for Zoo Tycoon 2."

This time I have added a pdf (Adobe) of my tutorial.

Yet another version, now it includes how to make lowres files, so the paths can be used if you have your resolution on low.

I have edited the tutorial and the icon file now has an alpha channel. The tutorial now has some more error cases and how to make invisible background for the icon.

I hope you find this useful as I spent a lot of time making it. Let me know if there are errors, if some things are unclear or you run in to other errors than listed in the tutorial. The tutorial is in WORD, this makes it easier to illustrate and highlight important things. This is a step by step guide to making paths for ZT2. I describe different ways to dds convert and recolor images, depending on the program you use. Also included are the files needed for making paths, these are as templates, where you just need to replace words, also the images are blank so these can be used. Just unzip the file to a folder and open the WORD file.

Here is the index of the tutorial
