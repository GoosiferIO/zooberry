A small boreal zoo located in the heart of Switzerland.

Made with some of my favorite animals including the Syrian Brown Bear my own creation with the help of STC.

> Note: All animals required are listed below under dependencies. The zoo file still mentions there are missing items, possibly because stationary object mods were not listed as requirements in the instructions. There is some missing fencing, for example, but otherwise the animals required are all listed.
