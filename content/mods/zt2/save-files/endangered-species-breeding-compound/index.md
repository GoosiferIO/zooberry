Hi I'm Amber an I'm going to take you on a tour of one of my zoos. This zoo was built to breed endangered animals from Africa and Asia. Our primary goal is to produce baby animals for introduction into other zoos. We here at the Endangered Species Breeding Compound add many babies every year to zoos all around the world, increasing breeding programs everywhere. One of our main projects at the moment (and the only animals being released to the wild at the moment) is the Bengal Tiger Release Program. You see that program later on the tour. So now we start. Welcome!
