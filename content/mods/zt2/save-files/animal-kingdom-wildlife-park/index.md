This is my greatest zoo to date! It represents all the world's biomes, and incorporates multiple user animals as well. The downloads needed are shown below.

> See below for links to the required downloads. The only missing mod is the Black Bear, which is not available on this site and the instructions were not clear on where to find it. The zoo is still playable without it.

Animals:
- African Leopard
- Sumatran Rhino
- King Penguin
- Siberian Tiger
- Amur Leopard
- Kodiak Bear
- Black Bear
