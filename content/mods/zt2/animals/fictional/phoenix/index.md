The phoenix was originally believed to be a myth, until a group of American scientists discovered a large flock several hundred miles south of Egypt. Upon finding other flocks in various other places, they pronounced the phoenix ‘critically endangered’. Several years later, after it became clear that the phoenix population was far larger than originally thought, but still threateningly small, the species was pronounced ‘endangered’.
