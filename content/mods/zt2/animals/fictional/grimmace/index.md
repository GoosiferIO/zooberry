summary: This dark bear will be happy in any biome, even though Boreal is its main
  one.
title: Grimmace
---
The markings on the Grimmace's body begin to appear as it ages and takes the weight of the world on its back. The Grimmace is a creature that is a mistake, in a sense. It was never meant to be, yet man created it with all of the pain and suffering and sin that is in this world. If people would stop the pain, the Grimmace may no longer be. It is also a very feared creature for its size and dark markings, but the truth is that because the Grimmace has seen so many bad things, it is joyful most of the time. It cannot stand to see people fight. So, it stops them by interfering and scaring them away. The abomination that is the Grimmace must be preserved, yet must never reproduce again, for when it does, it means that more pain is happening somewhere in the world.
