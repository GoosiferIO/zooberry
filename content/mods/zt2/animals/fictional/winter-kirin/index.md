The Winter Kirin is labeled as Critically Endangered not because it is threatened, but because all traces of them disappear off the face of the planet after the month of December. They are so common around winter, they are almost like vermin. They are said to be able to fly, but nobody has seen them do it. There are two kinds. One of them has curved, red-and-white antlers that taste slightly minty, and a glowing red nose. The other has gold antlers shaped like a certain kind of candle, and pointed hoofs similar in texture to clay. However, it is now possible to adopt them for your zoo, because zoologists have found their secret hideout.

These festive ungulates were released the day before Christmas Eve of 2009, and will help your guests get in mood for Christmas or Hannukkah!

**This download has one known issues:**
- The Hannukkah variation doesn't seem to ever show up, so you will only ever get Christmas kirin. Besides that this download is completely functional.
