They are both modelled on the fennec fox so I think you need the 'endangered animals' expansion to make them work. I have all the expansions and they work fine but you only need endangered animals expansion to play.

Umbreon: Umbreon is a pokemon, the dark evolution of eevee. It can interbreed with the 'Blue Umbreon'. I hope everyone enjoys playing with them =)
