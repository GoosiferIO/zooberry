The Snowstalker is a species of mammal created for the film The Future is Wild. The snowstalker is a saber-toothed mustelid, or weasel. It is descended from the wolverine that inhabits the tundra of Northern Europe 5 million years from now. The creators recognized the adaptability of wolverines and the past records of saber-toothed cats during the last ice age. The saber-teeth evolved to kill large shagrats, since the snowstalker should not waste too much energy bringing down large prey. All the snowstalker does is bite and wait for its victim to die. The snowstalker stands 60 centimeters tall and is covered in a thick white pelt for camouflage against the snow. The female snowstalker has a quick estrous cycle, lasting about three weeks. The reason for this is snowstalkers are solitary and have massive territories due to lack of prey.
