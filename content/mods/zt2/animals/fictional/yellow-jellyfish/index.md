title: Yellow Jellyfish
---
Due to their extreme rarity, very little is known about the yellow jellyfish. Their bright yellow coloration helps them to ward of predators and stay hidden in the colorful reefs. These jellyfish are very rare in the wild and are virtually only possible to see in Australian aquariums.

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

This particular jelly's skin was contributed by Csleesburg. Like many other downloads of its time, it was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- The formatting of the Zoopedia is messed up and some fields are missing.
- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
