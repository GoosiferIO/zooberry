**Keep some in mind with this download:**
- It has no Zoopedia. But why would it?
- It has no map location in-game. Because it is everywhere.
- It is so (blank) that it looks odd interacting with objects.
- It can't rest in shelters that are too close to the zoo walls, or it will (blank) and crash the game. Such impenetrable boundaries are not enough to stop it.
