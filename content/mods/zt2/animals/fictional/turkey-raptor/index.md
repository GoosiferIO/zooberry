Turkey Raptors are unusual beings that only appear once a year. They first originated in Europe, but these crafty beasts hid on the Mayflower, and thus became widespread everywhere. These vicious creatures are horrifically smart and enjoy hunting for humans out in the woods. They can leap up on trees. The Turkey Raptor is listed as Critically Endangered, not because their population is threatened, but because they only appear once a year. However, their hiding places have now been found and they can be sold to zoos for a high price. Their hatchlings are covered in fluffy pale yellow down and are harmless.

These festive raptors were released on the American Thanksgiving of 2009, and will help your guests get in mood to eat lots and lots of turkey!
