---
Blue-Backed Gorillas, as they are usually called, live high in the Alps, in the rainforests. These rainforests were thought to be myth, but when a group of scientists was exploring the Alps, they came across a beautiful forest with the freshest water and greenest plants that they had ever seen. Here they found the Blue-Backed Gorilla, also known as the Mini Gorilla, along with several other exotic animals such as blue and green dragons and rainbow-colored frogs. They named this area 'The Mystical Crater' for the whole forest was deep in a crater surrounded by the unforgiving mountains and harsh cold. They took some of the gorillas back to Europe with them and distributed them to the world, never telling anyone the exact location of the rainforest.
