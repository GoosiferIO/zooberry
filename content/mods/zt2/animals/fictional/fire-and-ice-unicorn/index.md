## Original Post

> Now I know it's been a very long time since I did any designing 😊 In fact I worked out it's about a year and a half since I created any UCI's, and I'm betting some of you didn't even know I was a designer 😂 well, I am, and always have been, just had a busy couple of years is all 😉 So I figured to get back in the saddle I would start with the most requested item, a unicorn 👏
> 
> This unicorn is based on the unicorn from ZT1, and is fully my own creation. This will not be the only unicorn release, I already have another done, and some horses as well, but I don't want to swamp you guys, so let's just start here K? I want feedback!! I want some serious testing!! Tear this thing to shreds 😉 I don't have time to test myself when I'm creating, so I'm trusting you guys to do it for me 😁
>
> Make 'em mad!! then try and make 'em happy again; breed 'em, make sure they grow up 😂 Go through the suggested lists and make sure they use everything 😉 Don't try to see how long they live...... they are virtually immortal 😂
>
> I have created one large flaw with this file intentionally..... everyone complains so much about the keepers putting down too many dishes and food for animals, so I removed this feature, this will mean you get error messages such as "Keeper 1 can't find a suitable location to place water" Weigh up the pros and con's of this and I want to hear opinions on whether to do all future downloads this way.

> The "Ice" is not the female, but a varient, so in reality you can have a family of "Fire unicorns" and a family of "Ice Unicorns" Inter breed them, or have two seperate exhibits 😂

## Release Notes

> Things I know about........
> The unicorn will not use the hollow log or Ice, this is something that even M$ can't change, (check out animals such as the Bison) but I didn't have the heart to take away their bananas 😂 they love them so!!
> There is a slight graphic error with the wood shelters, if you look from a certain angle, you can't see them, but move around, and you'll be able to again 😉
> The "Grown to adult" message does not appear, but I have better things to do than fix that 🤔 I'm guessing you guys would rather I spend time on the next one than fixing that? right? 😂
> At a distance it reverts to the zebra mesh, but at a distance you can hardly notice, once again, I'll fix it on the next one 😉
