summary: "Despite the remarkably vivid coloring of its underbelly, the Oriental fire-bellied toad merges perfectly with its surroundings."
---
Despite the remarkably vivid coloring of its underbelly, the Oriental fire-bellied toad merges perfectly with its surroundings; its dull brown to bright green back renders it almost invisible against the muddy margins of the pools and ponds where it lives. The back is also usually dotted with glossy black spots. The under parts are red or orange-red. This toad also has a tiny rounded head with large eyes that have heart-shaped pupils.

This animal was designed by Nintendo_6444 for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in eighth place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- It mates and gets pregnant but never laid eggs during testing, even after its pregnancy timer was at red for a while.
- While not outright a bug, this animal seems more finnicky about fulfilling its needs than is typical. Give them open land space and they should eat and drink just fine.
