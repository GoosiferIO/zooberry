title: Asian Small-Clawed Otter
---
The Asian Small-Clawed Otter is a wetlands mammal. It is smaller than the Sea Otter.

*Amblonyx cinereus* is found in coastal regions from southern India to the Malay Peninsula and southern China. *Amblonyx cinereus* individuals are commonly seen in the shallows of freshwater streams and rivers as well as coastal regions. There is often dense foliage nearby, which they use as defensive cover, and which restricts behavioral studies in the wild. Nesting burrows are dug into the muddy banks where they live. They have also been seen numerous times in rice paddies.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
