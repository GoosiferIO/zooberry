The puma is a large American cat that goes by many other names, including the cougar.

## Known Issues

- This animal lacks an icon, so a white square shows up in place of one.
- It has no lang files for any language so it is nameless and lacks a Zoopedia.
- The skin is white before placement, but the skin appears as expected afterwards.
- It has no map location in-game.
- The original version of the download on Northern Skies hated its primary biome, Alpine. This has been changed for the version hosted here.
This animal is otherwise functional from a gameplay perspective and can fulfill its needs, breed, and give birth.
