You're unlikely to encounter this little beauty while boating or diving. *Benthocodon pedunculata* is found in deep water habitats like Monterey Canyon and San Clemente Basin on the West Coast. A strong swimmer, it is usually associated with the bottom, where it feeds on crustaceans and foraminiferans. Numerous fine red tentacles (1000 to 2000) line the margin of the bell, which may be up to 4 cm diameter but is usually smaller. Also near the margin are furrows that extend toward the apex of the bell.

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

This particular jelly's skin was contributed by TurtleStork. Like many other downloads of its time, it was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has one known issue:**
- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
