These foxes live in the scrub, savannah and grasslands of Africa. To escape from predators, the bat-eared fox relies on speed and its incredible dodging ability. It can effectively reverse direction at a flat run without losing speed. *Otocyon megalotis* is the only species in the genus *Otocyon*.

This animal was designed by Komodo 93 for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in fifth place!

Includes a gift for guests to purchase.
