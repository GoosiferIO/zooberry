title: Chamois
---
They live in rocky areas and alpine meadows in Europe (especially the Alps, Carpathians) and in Asia minor. As a species, the chamois is still common and not threatened. However, several subspecies are on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Animals (1996). *Rupicapra rupicapra caucasica* is classified as vulnerable and *R. r. tatrica* as endangered, while *R. r. cartusiana* is classified as a critically endangered subspecies. There is insufficient data as to the current status of *R. r. asiatica*.

Unlike most other downloads by Penguinman, this one was created solely by himself. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase. 

Additionally, this animal was originally created for Snow Tiger's Europe Pack. It is unknown if any other creatures were ever shown or released for it.
