summary: "Common dolphins can be found throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans."
---
Common dolphins can be found throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They are abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in the Black Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Red Sea. At times, these dolphins follow the Gulf Stream up to Norwegian waters. In addition, scattered populations have been found in the Indian Ocean and waters near Japan. They seldom venture into the Arctic.

This animal was designed by Starstruck for the Skin an Animal Contest 2 at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 08/01/2006 and the winners were announced on 11/09. This particular animal came in first place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
