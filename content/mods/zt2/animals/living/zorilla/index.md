The zorilla, *Ictonyx striatus*, is a skunk-like mammal that lives in African savannas. It is also called the striped polecat. This mustelid (a type of weasel) has scent glands under the tail; when it is alarmed, it sprays a strong-smelling liquid. These nocturnal animals hunt at night and rest in a burrow or a rock crevice during the day. They have a life span of 5 years in captivity.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
