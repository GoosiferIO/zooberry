summary: "The Chacoan peccary's bristly coat is a speckled charcoal or brownish-grey, interspersed with long guard hairs."
---
The Chacoan peccary's bristly coat is a speckled charcoal or brownish-grey, interspersed with long guard hairs which may be up to 22 cm / 8.8 inches long. There is a whitish collar across the shoulders and under the chin, which is thinner and less distinct than that in the collared peccary. There is a black dorsal stripe which trails onto the tail. The head is extremely large, and the nose tapers to a snout disc made of cartilage.

This animal was designed by Samemo for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in seventh place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
