This ungulate is also known as the European bison. Some authors consider it (*Bison bonasus*) and the American bison (*Bison bison*) to be conspecific, grouping the two into a single species (Nowak, 1991). The taxonomic status of the genus *Bison* is also disputed, with some authorities placing it as a subgenus of *Bos*.
