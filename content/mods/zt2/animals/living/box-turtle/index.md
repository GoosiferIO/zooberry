The ornate box turtle is one of two turtle species on the Great Plains that are terrestrial. The other land-dweller is its close cousin the eastern box turtle (*Terrapene carolina*), whose range covers most of the eastern United States and includes the tallgrass prairie from Kansas to Texas. The eastern box turtle's shell is olive drab in color, which readily distinguishes it from the complicated color pattern of the ornate's.

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues
- Its lang files are broken, so it is nameless and lacks a zoopedia in-game.
- Its skin is black before placement in the preview window. The skin appears as expected within the actual game world however.
- The eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
- Strangely, it swims instead of walking on land. Not only does this apply to the animations, but it makes a swimming sound when moving around as well.
