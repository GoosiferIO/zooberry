Note: this animal has a different codename than the official Nile monitor from Zoo Tycoon 2: African Adventure. This means that they are compatible with eachother and you can use both at the same time.

The Nile monitor (*Varanus niloticus*) is distributed across most of Africa, except the northwest. It can get up to 7 feet (2.1 meters), but averages 4.5-5.5 feet (1.5-1.8 meters) This species is extremely hardy in captivity when properly maintained. The Nile monitor has a very aggressive temperament with a powerful bite and a lashing tail. With a lot of patience, frequent handling, and a well stocked first aid kit, Nile monitors can be tamed.

This animal was designed by Boblus for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in third place!

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues
- Its eyes are always closed as its blinking doesn't work properly.
- The eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
