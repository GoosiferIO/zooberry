---
Sloth bears live in the tropical rainforest of India. In the wild sloth bears are omnivorous, but their diet depends greatly on the local habitat and season. Diet can consist of termites or other insects, grubs, raiding of cultivated crops, grass, honey, eggs, carrion, fruits, berries and flowers. At the zoo its diet may include omnivore chow, insects, honey, browse, eggs, and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.

This animal was designed by Koala Komander for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in sixth place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
