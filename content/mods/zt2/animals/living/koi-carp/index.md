Koi carp are a type of domesticated cyprinid known for their wide range of color morphs. The koi in this mod exhibit three morphs as variants. Although adopted and viewed by guests as a normal animal, many older fish mods such as this one are coded to also resemble ambients in some ways. In particular, this animal won't eat or reproduce by design.

Unknown credits are given to Fishzilla, most likely for the base coding used.

**This download has a few known issues:**
- Even though it's coded not to breed, the koi carp will still mate and "lay eggs." However no eggs or offspring will actually appear. Instead, the mother's pregnancy status is removed without effect.
- It has no map location in-game.
- Although not a bug, it only has lang files for French.
