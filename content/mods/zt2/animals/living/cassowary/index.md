Cassowaries (genus *Casuarius*) are very large flightless birds native to the tropical forests of New Guinea and northeastern Australia. Some nearby islands also have small cassowary populations, but it is not known if these are natural or the result of the New Guinea trade in young birds. They are frugivorous; fallen fruit and fruit on low branches is the mainstay of their diet. They also eat fungi, snails, insects, frogs, snakes and other small animals.

## Known Issues

- Both the adults and young have a white plane above their eyes, a leftover of the eyelashes on the base ostrich model.
- This animal was finnicky about eating food from hollow logs during testing. Give them food from other sources instead and they'll have no gameplay issues.
