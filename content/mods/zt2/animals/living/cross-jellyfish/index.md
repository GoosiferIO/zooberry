This jelly is commonly seen in Monterey Bay during spring and summer, sometimes in large groups. A cross jellyâ€™s bell grows to about four inches in diameter and is rimmed with hundreds of fine white tentacles. Four white canals visible under the transparent bell form an obvious 'X' pattern, after which the cross jelly was named.

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

This particular jelly's skin was contributed by Otter Lord. Like many other downloads of its time, it was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues

- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
