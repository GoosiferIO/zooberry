Of all the gelatinous creatures visiting Monterey Bay, the purple-striped jelly is certainly among the most recognizable and spectacular. With a bell of up to 70 cm diameter, usually streaked with a radial pattern of stripes, and long, flowing oral arms, this jelly is quite impressive. The four frilly oral arms have a coiled appearance. Eight marginal tentacles alternate with eight sensory rhopalia. The tentacles are well armed with nematocysts and can produce a relatively painful sting.

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues
- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
