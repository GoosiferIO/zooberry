title: Asian Golden Cat
---
The Asian golden cat is a very mystical looking creature. Many Asian groups also have mystical stories and legends about this cat. What is known, however, is that this cat can be found in sub-tropical, tropical, boreal, and mountainous forests. More commonly in the tropical humid areas though. In some cases it can even be found at extremly high elevations.
