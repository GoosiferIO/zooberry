Ribbon eels are aptly named for their delicate movements, as they swim like a slender ribbon dancing in the water column. These colorful species are considered protandrous hermaphrodites, beginning life as a male, and as they mature, they switch sexes to female, developing female sex organs once ready to reproduce.

Credits are given to HENDRIX for the pelagic sea snake model. This download's original page mentioned that it required said sea snake from [REPTILIA](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/expansive-packs/reptilia-abc/>) to work, however that didn't seem to be the case during testing and no issues seemed to arise from REPTILIA not being installed. Please contact AubreyKitsune or Goosifer if you experience otherwise!

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- The Zoopedia article's fun facts and main information are empty.
- Although not a bug, it's worth noting that this animal is rigid in its animations.
