title: Nubian Ibex
---
The Nubian ibex is relatively small compared to other ibexes. Its coat is a light sandy brown in colour with the hindquarters lighter. The underparts are almost white, and the upper side of the tail is darker. Males have a dark stripe on their front legs and one down their back, as well as a dark beard. During the October breeding season, the neck, chest, shoulders, upper legs, and sides of males become dark brown to almost black in color.
