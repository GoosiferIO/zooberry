The lesser flamingo is herbivorous, feeding solely on *Spirulina plantensis*, a blue-green algae growing within a very limited range of pH: 10.4 - 10.5. They are surface feeders filtering the top inch or two of water where the *Spirulina* is to be found with the deep-keeled bill that is specialized for very fine food particles. They swim well and are able to forage over the complete surface of a lake (the "swim and skim" technique).

It is made out of the greater flamingo and lives in African Savannah. It is also compatible with Wetlands so it can be mixed with a greater variety.

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known issues
- The egg lacks an icon, so a white square shows up in place of one. Otherwise this download is completely functional and its gameplay is without any problems.
