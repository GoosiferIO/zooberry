This jellyfish resembles a fried egg when seen from above. Amphipods and larvae of the graceful crab, *Cancer gracilis*, are commonly found on its tentacles, bell and oral arms. It preys upon *Aurelia aurita* (the moon jelly) and is usually found in or close to areas with large numbers of them. It commonly reaches 50 cm in diameter; its bell is translucent to milky with a bright yellow center; the bell margin has 16 large lobes that alternate with smaller lobes; each lobe has up to 25 tentacles.

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

This particular jelly's skin was contributed by Sheltiefan. Like many other downloads of its time, it was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
- Its location icon is a white square in its Zoopedia article.
