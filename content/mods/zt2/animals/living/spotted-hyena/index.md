Spotted hyenas are the largest member of the family Hyaenidae. This family also includes three other hyena species: the aardwolf; the striped hyena (*Hyaena hyaena*); and the brown hyena (*Parahyaena brunnea*). Many researchers consider hyenas the evolutionary 'link' between dogs and cats, but more closely related to cats.
