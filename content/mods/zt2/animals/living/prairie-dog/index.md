## Other Credits
- Hendrix - Original model and coding


## Issues
- Preview menu icon is visibly-contrasted with the other icons.
- When approaching the animal to clean it in zookeeper mode, the selection marker that normally shows below a dirty animal is visibly bugged and might show purple in error. Appears fine after cleaning the animal.
