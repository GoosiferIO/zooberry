Leopard tortoises have a huge range, being found on the savannahs of Africa from the Sudan South to the Cape Province of South Africa. Their diet in the wild consists of grasses, cactus and weeds. There are, depending on your taxonomist of choice, two subspecies. Many taxonomists consider these to be area variants and not worthy of subspecies designation. In captivity leopard tortoises do need UVB and Vitamin D3. UVB can be given through artificial lighting. Although if weather permits, an hour or two outside is sufficient.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has a few known issues:**
- Its skin is black before placement in the preview window. The skin appears as expected within the actual game world however and gameplay is unaffected.
- The eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
- While not outright a bug, this animal can suffer a similar issue to the vanilla tortoise species, where its slow speed combined with spaced out items can cause it to not fulfill its needs in time to keep it happy.
