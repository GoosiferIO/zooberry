The Indian hyena is a specific population of striped hyena, *Hyaena hyaena*, from the Indian subcontinent. It would go well in Indian grassland themed areas of your zoos alongside the ratel. An estimated 1,000-3,000 hyenas live in India today.


**This download has a few known issues:**

- This animal lacks an icon, so a white square shows up in place of one.
- When you zoom out all the way, adults' skins turn white. Young will turn white when you are around halfway zoomed out. This subsides when you zoom back in.
- Although not a bug, it only has lang files for French.
- Otherwise this download is completely functional. Nothing is too obtrusive and its gameplay is without any problems.
