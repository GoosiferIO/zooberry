Also known as the South American red-footed tortoise, the males grow up to 13.5 inches (30.4 cm) and are somewhat larger than females, which average 11.25 inches (28.9 cm) in length. It has several yellow head scales and a horizontal bar behind its eye. The carapace (shell top) is black with a small, distinct, yellow area around the areola on each scute (shell scale). Mature specimens have distinctive incurving of sides, giving them a well-defined 'waist.'

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues

- Its skin is black before placement in the preview window. The skin appears as expected within the actual game world however and gameplay is unaffected.
- The eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
- While not outright a bug, this animal can suffer a similar issue to the vanilla tortoise species, where its slow speed combined with spaced out items can cause it to not fulfill its needs in time to keep it happy.
