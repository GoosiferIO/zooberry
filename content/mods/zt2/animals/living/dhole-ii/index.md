The dhole (*Cuon alpinus*) is a species of canid native to Southeast Asia. It is the only extant member of the genus *Cuon*, which differs from *Canis* by the reduced number of molars and greater number of teats. It primarily preys on medium-sized ungulates, which it hunts by tiring them out in long chases, and kills by disemboweling them. Unlike most social canids (but similar to African wild dogs), dholes let their pups eat first at a kill.
