Generally arboreal, or tree dwelling. Crocodile monitors inhabit rainforests and adjacent savannas. These reptiles are also called Papua monitors because they only live on the island of Papua New Guinea.

This animal was designed by Zooasaurus for the Skin an Animal Contest 2 at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 08/01/2006 and the winners were announced on 11/09. This particular download received a runner up position!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- The skin looks weird and doesn't fit the mesh, since it uses the Nile monitor UV on the Komodo dragon model.
- It lays eggs but they never hatched during testing, even after their hatch timer was at red for a while.
