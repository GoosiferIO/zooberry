The Atlantic Sailfish is uber amazing: It’s also AWESOME and POINTY! (quote from ShenTirag)

Atlantic sailfish appear to grow to only about one half the size of Pacific specimens, though recent information suggests they can grow larger than previously recognized. The Atlantic sailfish’s most prominent feature is their first, sail-like dorsal fin, commonly referred to as its 'sail dorsal.' The sail dorsal is high and long, having between 37 and 49 rays. It is steel blue with light and dark blue spots. Coloration of the body is dark blue to dark blue-green on top, brown-blue on the sides fading to silver-white underneath.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has one known issue:**
-The eggs are invisible, although they do hatch and function just fine. Gameplay is unaffected.
