Gray's monitor gets its common name from its previous scientific name of *Varanus grayi*. It is found only on southern Luzon and Catanduanes Island in the Philippines, where it inhabits the forested slopes of low mountains. Possibly its range was much larger in the past, but the development of agriculture has removed its habitat from most valleys. The hillsides frequented by the lizard are covered with thick rainforest and have many cliffs and rock outcrops.

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues
- The eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
