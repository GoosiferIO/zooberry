title: Maned Wolf
---
The maned wolf appears as a cross among different species: the head and coloring of a wolf, the large ears of an African hunting dog and the body of a hyena. Some think the maned wolf looks like a mix between a wolf and a fox. What do you think? Maned wolves are about 3 feet tall at shoulder height and weigh 50 pounds. Their body is covered with golden-red fur, and has black legs and a black mane.
