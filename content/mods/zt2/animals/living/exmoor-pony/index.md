“The Exmoor Pony is a hardy, sturdy breed of semi-feral pony, one of many of the mountain and moorland ponies of the British Isles. They are native to Exmoor, a large area of moorland in the counties of Devon and Cornwall. They are more genetically pure than their relatives, the Dartmoor pony, and are therefore more similar in their physical appearances. Their hardy nature means that they will eat poor quality grazing and by grazing over a wide area, spread biodiversity in their region. They are often kept on common land, which is unfenced, and branded to show ownership.”
