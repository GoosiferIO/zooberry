Arctic foxes are pure white in winter and grey-brown in summer. They can also be light brown, grey, chocolate, or black with a bluish hue. Arctic foxes live in the Arctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America. They like to roam in the tundra, usually near the coast. Arctic foxes are omnivorous, but feed particularly on small mammals (lemmings), eggs, carrion and berries.
