Greetings all, I am very pleased to announce the release of the Alaskan Timber Wolf. Coded to be fully independent, it should not require any expansions. This Boreal Forest animal is also compatible with Alpine and Tundra. Includes 4 different skins, pack behavior, and realistic mating dynamics. Comes with a new t-shirt gift and higher donation value.
