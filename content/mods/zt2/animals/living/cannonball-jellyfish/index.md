title: Cannonball Jellyfish
---
The cannonball jellyfish (*Stomolophus meleagris*), also known as the cabbagehead jellyfish, is a species of jellyfish in the family Stomolophidae. Its common name derives from its similarity to a cannonball in shape and size. Its dome-shaped bell can reach 25 cm (10 in) in diameter. The rim is often colored with brown pigment. There are several known undescribed *Stomolophus* species found in the Pacific and South Atlantic that exhibit pale to blue pigment.

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

This particular jelly's skin was contributed by Nique. Like many other downloads of its time, it was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
- Its Zoopedia article text is actually the flower hat jellyfish's.
