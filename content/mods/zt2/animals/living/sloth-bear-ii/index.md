Issues


- The female icon is a white square.
- The preview 3D model lacks a texture and shows as black.


Other Credits


Based on the the Zoopedia in this mod's files, at the very least it seems the coding is based on [Koala Komander and Penguinman's Sloth Bear](https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/animals/living/sloth-bear/) from 2007, but otherwise the model and textures are different.
