Red foxes are native to the Nearctic, Palearctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian regions, and have been introduced to areas in the Australian region. Red foxes are found throughout Canada, Alaska, almost all of the contiguous United States, all of Europe and Britain, and almost all of Asia, including Japan. There are also several populations in North Africa. They are the most widely distributed wild carnivores in the world. Red foxes were introduced into Australia in the nineteenth century.

This animal was designed by Brownwolf for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in first place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
