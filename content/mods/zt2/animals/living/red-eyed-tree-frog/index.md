title: Red Eyed Tree Frog
---
The first thing you are bound to notice on this amphibian are the bold, bright red eyes. This frog, as an adult, is brightly colored all over. The body is predominantly neon green but it is usually splashed with other colors like blue or yellow. The upper legs are usually bright blue and the feet are orange or red. The coloration of this frog is definitely eye catching. The red-eyed tree frog can change its color with its mood from a darker green to a reddish-brown.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- It mates and gets pregnant but never laid eggs during testing, even after its pregnancy timer was at red for a while.
- While not outright a bug, this animal seems more finnicky about fulfilling its needs than is typical. Give them open land space and they should eat and drink just fine. Additionally, it seems to do better about eating from hollow logs than from terrain food, so it's recommended to give them a hollow log with insects as their food source.
