A vibrant tree frog native to Central and South America, known for its bright red eyes.

It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Known Issues
- It mates and gets pregnant but never laid eggs during testing, even after its pregnancy timer was at red for a while.
- While not outright a bug, this animal seems more finnicky about fulfilling its needs than is typical. Give them open land space and they should eat and drink just fine. Additionally, it seems to do better about eating from hollow logs than from terrain food, so it's recommended to give them a hollow log with insects as their food source.
