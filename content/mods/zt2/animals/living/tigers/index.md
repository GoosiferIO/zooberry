summary: Bengal tiger pack with four natural coat variations.
title: Tigers
zt2tags: ["All", "ZT2", "Animals", "Living", "Felids", "Mammals"]

The bengal tiger has four natural coat colourations, and this pack allows adoption and breeding of all of them. There are White tigers, Snow white tigers and Golden tabby tigers. All are capable of interbreeding and to a limited extent breeding with the original bengal tiger (only male bengals and female varients can breed due to coding restrictions). To reflect the complex and suprising nature of tiger colouration genetics, these tigers can also randomly give birth to cubs of a different colouration, just as in real life. These three are designed to work together as a pack, and so if only one is downloaded there may be glitches as it may try to give birth to one you haven't downloaded and cause an error. Therefore all three must be installed in the game for them to work properly, you don't need to adopt all three just having them in the game files is enough =)
