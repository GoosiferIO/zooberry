title: Dwarf Cassowary
---
*Casuarius bennetti* is found on the island of New Guinea. The majority of the population resides in Papua New Guinea, on the eastern side of the island. These birds are also found on the islands of New Britain and Yapen, but their presence on these islands is likely due to extensive trade in cassowaries from New Guinea. Dwarf cassowaries are regarded as high altitude birds in relation to other cassowaries. Their habitat is steep mountainous terrain up to 3000 m (10000 ft) that is thickly vegetated with subtropical to tropical forests.

The primary version of this download was made to accompany the user-made [Montane Forest](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/biomes/montane-forest/>) biome, and will require it in order to work properly.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with other users. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Alternative Version

The 'alternative' version of this file places the dwarf cassowary in the base game Tropical Rainforest biome, rather than Montane Forest. This means that unlike the main file it does not require any other downloads. Use this version if you don't want to add additional biomes to your game.
