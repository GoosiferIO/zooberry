*Casuarius bennetti* is found on the island of New Guinea. The majority of the population resides in Papua New Guinea, on the eastern side of the island. These birds are also found on the islands of New Britain and Yapen, but their presence on these islands is likely due to extensive trade in cassowaries from New Guinea. Dwarf cassowaries are regarded as high altitude birds in relation to other cassowaries. Their habitat is steep mountainous terrain up to 3000 m (10000 ft) that is thickly vegetated with subtropical to tropical forests.

The 'primary' version of this file places the dwarf cassowary in the base game Tropical Rainforest biome, rather than Montane Forest. This means that unlike the alternative file it does not require any other downloads. Use this version if you don't want to add additional biomes to your game.

Includes a gift for guests to purchase.

## Alternative Version

The secondary version of this download was made to accompany the user-made [Montane Forest](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/biomes/montane-forest/>) biome, and will require it in order to work properly.
