summary: A white dorsal stripe extends back over the head from the nose of the American
  badger.
title: American Badger
---
The face of the American badger is distinct. The ventrum is a buffy color. The throat and chin are whitish, and the face has black patches. A white dorsal stripe extends back over the head from the nose. In northern populations, this stripe ends near the shoulders. In southern populations, however, it continues over the back to the rump. The body is flattened, and the legs are short and stocky. The fur on the back and flanks of the animal ranges from grayish to reddish.
