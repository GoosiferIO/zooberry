*Dendrobates pumilio*, the strawberry poison dart frog, is common in the Atlantic lowland tropical forests of Central America. The greatest concentration of *D. pumilio* has been observed in Costa Rica (McVey et al. 1981). A steady supply of water is needed for reproduction. Strawberry poison dart frogs are tiny, measuring only 1/2-2 inches. Both sexes are bright red with purple-blue legs, although some specimens have been found in Panama sporting a variety of other colors including orange, green, and blue.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Credit is given to Xtrat for the first frog.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- It mates and gets pregnant but never laid eggs during testing, even after its pregnancy timer was at red for a while.
- While not outright a bug, this animal seems more finnicky about fulfilling its needs than is typical. Give them open land space and they should eat and drink just fine. Additionally, it seems to do better about eating from hollow logs than from terrain food, so it's recommended to give them a hollow log with insects as their food source.
