Bonobos (*Pan paniscus*) live in the forests located centrally in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). Bonobo habitat lies in the Congo Basin. This area is located south of an arc formed by the Congo River (formerly the Zaire River) and its headwater, the Lualaba River, and north of the Kasai River.

This animal was designed by Samemo for the Skin an Animal Contest 2 at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 08/01/2006 and the winners were announced on 11/09. This particular animal came in second place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
