title: Lion's Mane Jellyfish
---
*Cyanea capillata* can be found in the cooler regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, North Sea and Baltic. They are especially prevalent near the east coast of Britain. They are found in the pelagic zone as medusae and then benthic zone as polyps. Its bell normally ranges in diameter from 30 to 80 cm, with some individuals growing up to a maximum of 180 cm. The oral arms are purple with reddish or yellow tentacles, hence the common name 'Lion's Mane.'

This animal was originally part of a pack known as the Jellyfish Pack. The Jellyfish Pack was done at ZooAdmin and each jellyfish is skinned by a different member of that site. These animals will not reproduce and do not require any food/enrichment, acting like ambients. But, guests will still view and enjoy them.

This particular jelly's skin was contributed by Budgielover101. Like many other downloads of its time, it was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has one known issue:**
- Although the jellyfish don't need to be fed, they do eat through a unique behavior of sifting the water for food. Sometimes they don't perform certain need-fulfilling behaviors like sifting when they should, which will lead to that need being unfulfilled. This is temporary and resolves itself on its own without the need for player intervention.
