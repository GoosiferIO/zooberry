title: Clouded Leopard
---
The clouded leopard is sufficiently distinct from other members of the Felidae family, due mainly to the unique shape of its skull, to be placed in a separate genus - *Neofelis*. Outwardly the cat is immediately recognisable by its distinctive coat patterning. The base colour of the fur is pale yellow/brown and is marked on the body by large irregular shaped markings, each dark brown/black around the edge and lighter in the middle and it is this ‘cloud’ pattern that give the cat its name.
