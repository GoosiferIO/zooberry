The common bream is a freshwater fish from various types of waterways in Europe. It generally lives in rivers, and in nutrient-rich lakes and ponds with muddy bottoms and plenty of algae. Although adopted and viewed by guests as a normal animal, many older fish mods such as this one are coded to also resemble ambients in some ways. In particular, this animal won't eat or reproduce by design.

**This download has a few known issues:**
- In the English version of the game, the Zoopedia is untranslated from Dutch.
- Even though it's coded not to breed, the bream will still mate and "lay eggs." However no eggs or offspring will actually appear. Instead, the mother's pregnancy status is removed without effect.
- It has no map location in-game.
