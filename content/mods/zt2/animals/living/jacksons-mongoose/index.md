Jackson's mongooses are typically a greyish or dull brownish in color, with the legs being black. Young Jackson's mongooses have longer and lighter fur than adults. They closely resemble the Ichneumon mongoose, except *Bdeogale* lack dewclaws and have larger premolars. The groove between their nose and upper lip is devoid of hair. Their front paws are also devoid of hair, but the back paws are furred.

This download was made to accompany the user-made [Montane Forest](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/biomes/montane-forest/>) biome, and will require it in order to work properly.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
