Borneo pygmy elephants have significantly different characteristics from their cousins found on mainland Asia and Sumatra. They are relatively tame and mild-tempered compared to other Asian elephants, they are also smaller in size. There are estimated to be fewer than 1,500 of the elephants. Compared to other elephants, Borneo's pygmy elephants are baby-faced and gentle-natured.

This animal was designed by August for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal came in second place!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
