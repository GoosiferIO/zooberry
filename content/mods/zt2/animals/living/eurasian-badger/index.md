A cute little temperate forest animal that lives in Eurasia. It is coded by Penguinman and recolored by Exitree. It contains one variant skin and must have ES to run. Thanks! Variant skins updated 12-4-05. Baby skin updated 12-11-05. Alphabetized on 12-21-05.

## Known Issues
- It has no map location in-game. This animal is otherwise functional from a gameplay perspective and can fulfill its needs, breed, and give birth.
