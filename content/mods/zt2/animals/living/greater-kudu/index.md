This is the Greater Kudu, the second largest antelope in Africa. Must have the Addax download to work.

Greater kudu are found in a variety of habitats throughout Africa. As long as they have good cover, greater kudu are able to survive in the settled areas of Africa. Greater kudu can be found in habitats that provide bush and thicket cover. In the rains, greater kudu remain in the deciduous woodlands. During the dry season they can be found in along the banks of rivers where there is rich vegetation.

This animal was designed by Angilas44 (now known as Burnt_Gecko) for the Skin an Animal Contest 2 at ZT2DC, and was initially hosted there as an exclusive download before being uploaded to ZooMania as well. The contest was announced on 08/01/2006 and the winners were announced on 11/09. This particular animal came in third place!

Includes a gift for guests to purchase.
