The dugong (sometimes referred to as a 'sea cow') is a mammal- that is, it suckles its young. Dugongs are large grey mammals which spend their entire lives in the sea. Though aquatic they breathe air through lungs, and have live babies rather than laying eggs like fish. Dugongs swim by moving their broad spade-like tail in an up and down motion, and by use of their two flippers. 

Although not a bug, it may be worth noting that as this download was created before the advent of meshing for marine animals, the tail resembles a manatee.

This download was the first release for ZT2 by popular machinima creator Dannybob. It no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
