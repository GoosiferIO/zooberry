**Ornithocheirus**

Ornithocheirus was a pterodactyloid pterosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of North America (Maastrichtian stage, about 68 to 65.5 million years ago), and one of the largest known flying animals of all time. It was a member of the Azhdarchidae, a family of advanced toothless pterosaurs with unusually long, stiffened necks. Its name comes from the Mesoamerican feathered serpent god Ornithocheirusalcoatl.
