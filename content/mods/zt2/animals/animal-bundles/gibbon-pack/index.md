Context
=

On the original download page, attention was called towards the fact that the hollock gibbon lives in Temperate Forest.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. Each animal includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Known issues
=

- At least one animal, the female white-handed gibbon, shows up as a blank white skin when dirty. This isnâ€™t obtrusive as long as you keep your animals clean and gameplay is without any problems.
