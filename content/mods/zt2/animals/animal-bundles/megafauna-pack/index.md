## Known issues (07-24-2023)

- There is a bug in the zoopedia that prevents the Indricothere from showing up as a zoopedia entry or as a purchasable animal. I noticed many named entries in the xml files do not match up which could be causing the problem. 
- Same deal with the Andrewsarchus. Titanus seems to work fine though. Unsure about Argentavius.
- Compatibility determination could be innacurate; original post with instructions is long gone.
