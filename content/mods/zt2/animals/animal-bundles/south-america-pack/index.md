Here is the South America Pack Part 1!  

From the high Andes Mountains to the lush tropical Amazon Forest lives an amazing array of wildlife.  
Welcome to South America!  

This pack includes:  
- Kit Fox  
- Jaguarundi  
- Brocket Deer  
- Orinoco Crocodile  
- Mountain Tapir  
- Grison  

Watch out for Part 2!  

All coding is done by Penguinman, and skins by Acapella.  
Enjoy!  

*ES required!*


## Known issues

- The kit fox's skin is black before placement in the preview window. The skin appears as expected within the actual game world however and gameplay is unaffected.
- The Orinoco crocodile's eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
- While not outright a bug, the jaguarondi sometimes (but not always) seems more finnicky about fulfilling its hunger need than is typical. It seems to (again sometimes) prioritize other tasks over eating. If you place down fresh food when they complain, that can help mitigate this issue.
