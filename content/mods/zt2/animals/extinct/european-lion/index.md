Note: this animal shares a codename with the official cave lion from Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals. This means that if you have that expansion pack, this download's files will conflict and it won't appear in your game.

Due to their remote extinction, little is known about this subspecies of lion. It became extinct due to excessive hunting (lion hunting was popular among the Macedonians), over-exploitation and outcompetition by feral dogs. Along with the Barbary lion, the European lion was used in the Roman arenas. Further details about their extinction are unknown.

This animal was designed by Bobosmokey for the first Skin an Animal Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 02/04/2006 and the winners were announced on 03/20. This particular animal was technically disqualified since it was extinct.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. Due to its conflict with Extinct Animals, this download couldn't be tested in-game, however Penguinman's downloads are usually issue free. Its files contain a gift for guests to purchase.
