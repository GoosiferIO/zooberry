title: Aliwalia
---
This huge carnivore will eat meat and fish. It can bring down small or large prey and could reach length of twelve metres (three times larger than its cousin Herrerasaurus), which meant it could prey on the large prosauropods. It was found in South Africa.

As an interesting note, Aliwalia is now considered a junior synonym of the basal sauropodomorph Eucnemesaurus, making it a 'prosauropod' itself rather than a hunter of them.

Baryonyx made the original JPOG mod that this is based on, and Jules brought it to Zoo Tycoon 2. Credits are given to BioHazard for importing the JPOG models.

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- According to the original download page, it uses BioHazard's Dryosaurus icon.
- Its Zoopedia article doesn’t work.
- Even though it will mate, it has bugged reproduction. It will “lay eggs” without any appearing. Instead, the mother’s pregnancy status is removed without effect.

Special thanks to Thom for recovering this download for ZooBerry!
