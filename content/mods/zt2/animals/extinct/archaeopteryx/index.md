Notes by Author
===

-  Archaeopteryx is sexually dimorphic (coding is the same as for my parrots, males have blue tails and females have brown) and has fossils.

===
Known Issues
===

- When selected the image in the window is solid black. The animal stays normal just the selected image is skinless.
- Male keeps wings stiffly open when being placed. Don't worry though they go back to normal once placed on the map.
- No egg icon but the eggs themselves work perfectly. 
- Some of the facts in the zoopedia are outside of the fact box but do not obscure the text.
- Young sometimes turn giant sized right before becoming an adult. They then shrink to normal size.
