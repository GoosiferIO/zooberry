Toxodon ('Archer's bow teeth') is a large genus of extinct South American ungulate, ecologically similar to the hippopotamus, that lived in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs in South America. Toxodon was among the few notoungulates to survive the Great American Interchange, and is presumed to have died out due to human predation and/or climatic changes during the Pleistocene. Its fossils were first studied by Charles Darwin on his voyage on the Beagle.
