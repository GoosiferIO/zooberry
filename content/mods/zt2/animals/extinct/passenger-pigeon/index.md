title: Passenger Pigeon
---
The passenger pigeon (*Ectopistes migratorius*) is an extinct species of pigeon that once was the most common in North America, becoming extinct in only one century. The passenger pigeon was similar in size to living pigeons, females were smaller and with a less colorful plumage than males. They were very sociable and migrated in enormous flocks. They migrated in winter from the southern territories of Canada and USA, to the Gulf of Mexico, were even found in Cuba once, and during the summer they stayed in the Rocky Mountains. 

Credits were given to Kingcobrasaurus for making it fly.
