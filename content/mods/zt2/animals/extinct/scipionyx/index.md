title: Scipionyx
---
In the 1990s, a fossil collector watched Jurassic Park and noticed that the Velociraptors resembled a small, unknown fossil he had in his collection. He took it to scientists and they identified it as a new dinosaur, Scipionyx. Scipionyx, often informally called 'Sippy', was significant because it was one of the few baby dinosaurs to be preserved, and it was preserved well - scientists found the windpipe, colon, and muscle tissue, proving that the chicks were precocial, and the mother wasn't far behind.

Includes some exclusive sounds: the baby Kasai Rex chirp noises and the baby Afroraptor chirp noises from African Abnormalities. Additionally, it has fossils for you to dig up and clone it at the Extinct Research Lab!

- The formatting of the Zoopedia is a bit messed up.
- It has no map location in-game. This animal is otherwise functional from a gameplay perspective and can fulfill its needs, breed, and give birth.
