Pinacosaurus ('plank lizard') is a genus of medium-sized ankylosaur dinosaurs that lived from the late Santonian to the late Campanian stages of the Late Cretaceous period (roughly 80â€“75 million years ago), in Mongolia and China. Like all ankylosaurids, it had a bony club at the end of its tail which it used as a defensive weapon against predators such as Tarbosaurus. The most unusual element in the original specimen is the presence of two additional egg-shaped holes, one on top of the other, where the nostrils are normally found.

Kingcobrasaurus was known for his wild speculation in portraying extinct animals. He extrapolated the additional holes to mean that this dinosaur had a trunk that could be inflated. He also noted that he liked to call this dinosaur the 'Pineconesaurus.' In your zoo, Pinacosaurus will make lots of loud noises with its trunk. The babies will move in herds. Additionally, it has fossils for you to dig up and clone it at the Extinct Research Lab!

This animal was originally created as a teaser for the Ultimate Pack of Dinosaurs, a user-made expansion with some similarly speculative designs. This page will be updated to link it here if said pack is ever added to ZooBerry.
