---
This is Kingcobrasaurus' first-ever crocodilian. It's Mourasuchus, the strange planktivorous crocodile. A gentle giant, this beautiful yet lethargic reptile cruised the Miocene rivers, filtering plankton and shrimp through its teeth like the big blue whale. But they can be ferocious at times - they can swallow any animal when they're angry!

Makes a good companion for Purussaurus, since it lived at the same time and place. It has fossils for you to dig up and clone it at the Extinct Research Lab!

**This download has a couple known issues:**
- It has no map location in-game.
- While not necessarily a bug, this animal seems more finnicky about fulfilling its needs than is typical. During testing it would sometimes not eat even when hungry. This may have to do with the amount of open space it had relative to its size.
