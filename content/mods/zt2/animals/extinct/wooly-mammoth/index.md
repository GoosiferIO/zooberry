summary: Mammoth remains have been found in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America.
title: Wooly Mammoth
---
Mammoth remains have been found in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. They are believed to have originally evolved in North Africa about 4.8 million years ago, where bones of *Mammuthus africanavus* have been found in Chad, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. Despite their African ancestry, they are in fact more closely related to the modern Asian Elephant than either of the two African elephants.

As it was created before Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals or the Dino Danger Pack premium download, this animal uses the Critically Endangered conservation status rather than the Extinct one. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
