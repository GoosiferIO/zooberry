The Tarpan is a prehistoric wild horse type that ranged from Southern France and Spain eastward to central and southern Russia and into nothern China. Cave drawings of Tarpan horses can be found in France and Spain, and artifacts showing this breed can be found in Southern Russia where this horse was domesticated by Scythian nomads in about 3000 B.C.

As it was created before Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals or the Dino Danger Pack premium download, this animal uses the Critically Endangered conservation status rather than the Extinct one. It includes a gift for guests to purchase.

**This download has one known issue:**
- The young have a blank white skin. When they age into adults their skin appears as normal, and there are no other known bugs. Gameplay is unimpacted.
