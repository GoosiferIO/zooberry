title: Yunnan White-Handed Gibbon
---
This Yunnan white-handed gibbon was a subspecies of the lar gibbon located in the Yunnan province of China. Recently (when the download was first released in 2009), researchers determined that this gibbon is extinct. This download was created as a tribute to this gibbon and a reminder to all of the danger wildlife is currently in.

Although the Yunnan white-handed gibbon is technically considered Data Deficient by the IUCN, this download has been classified as 'Extinct' on ZooBerry due to the previously mentioned determination by researchers that it is most likely extinct. It is treated as an extinct animal in-game as well.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It has no known issues and includes a gift for guests to purchase.
