Pterodaustro (meaning 'southern wing') was a Cretaceous pterosaur from South America, living 140 million years ago. Pterodaustro had a wingspan of 133 centimetres (4.36 ft). It was discovered in 1970 by José Bonaparte in the Lagarcito Formation, situated in the San Luis Province of Patagonia, Argentina. It has also been found in Chile. Pterodaustro had about a thousand bristle-like modified teeth in its lower jaw that might have been used to strain crustaceans, plankton, algae, and other small creatures from the water.

Kingcobrasaurus was known for his wild speculation in portraying extinct animals. He believed that like flamingos, this pterosaur's diet may have resulted in a pink hue. Thus, he called it the 'flamingo pterosaur.'

**This download has a few known issues:**
- Its Zoopedia article doesn’t work.
- Even though it will mate, it has bugged reproduction. It will “lay eggs” without any appearing. Instead, the mother’s pregnancy status is removed without effect.
- It has no map location in-game.
