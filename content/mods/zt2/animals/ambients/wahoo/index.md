Note: this is an ambient, not an adoptable animal. This means it will spawn in the environment at random intervals.

**From Zooasaurus' original post:**

"The Wahoo is a game fish, found in the open see, and is related to the Marlin and Mackerel.  I whipped this up in my spare time a while ago, it only appears in groups of two.  Requires MM2."
