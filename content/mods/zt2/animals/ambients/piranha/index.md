summary: "These piranhas will form interesting schools in your jungle tanks."
---
Note: this is an ambient, not an adoptable animal. This means it will spawn in the environment at random intervals.

These piranhas will form interesting schools in your jungle tanks. They were designed by Samemo for the Ambient Recolor Contest at ZT2DC, and were hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 06/18/2007 and the winners were announced on 08/26. This particular download came in third place!

Appears in Tropical Rainforest environments in-game.
