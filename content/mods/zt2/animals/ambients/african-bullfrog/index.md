Note: this is an ambient, not an adoptable animal. This means it will spawn in the environment at random intervals.

A large species of frog from over a dozen African countries. It was designed by Angilas44 (now known as Burnt_Gecko) for the Ambient Recolor Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 06/18/2007 and the winners were announced on 08/26. This particular download tied for first place!

Appears in Savannah and Wetlands environments in-game.
