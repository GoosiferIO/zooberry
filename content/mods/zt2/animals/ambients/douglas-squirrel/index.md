Note: this is an ambient, not an adoptable animal. This means it will spawn in the environment at random intervals.

The Douglas squirrel lives from the Sierra Nevada north through coastal British Colombia. It was designed by Gloria for the Ambient Recolor Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 06/18/2007 and the winners were announced on 08/26. This particular download tied for first place!

Appears in Boreal Forest environments in-game.
