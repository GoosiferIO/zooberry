This is part of a set of eight biome packs that were made by the Zoo Admin Design Team many years ago. Many members helped out. Please note that due to how old these packs are, not everything is up to the same standard that Penguinman would have later used. Modeling, for instance, was not discovered until after these packs were made. However, Penguinman did feel that many of the plants, objects and animals would be useful and that's why he reuploaded them onto Penguin's Peak. Hope you enjoy!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with other users. Each animal includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Known issues
=

- The skins of the desert tortoise, wild burro, and oasis are black before placement in the preview window. The skins appear as expected within the actual game world however.
- Strangely, the desert tortoise swims instead of walking on land. Not only does this apply to the animations, but it makes a swimming sound when moving around as well.
- The desert tortoise and fire lizard's eggs took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
- The fire lizard is oriented sideways when resting in a burrow or on a heat rock.
