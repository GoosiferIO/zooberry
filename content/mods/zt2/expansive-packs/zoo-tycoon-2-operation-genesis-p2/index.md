Installation


Place `zzzzzz_zt2_operation_genesis_part_b_v1.0".z2f` in the following path: 

`C\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2`


OPTIONAL


The folder named `zzzzzz_zt2_og_sounds.z2f` contains new sounds for your game as well as a new main menu theme. Place this folder in the following path:

`C\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2`

Once you place the folder in the main Zoo Tycoon 2 directory. Take `Zoo Tycoon 2 Operation Genesis - Main Menu.mp3`, `JPOG_ambience.wav` and `JPOG_frogs.wav` in the following directory: 

`C\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2\sounds`

The file named `splashimage.bmp` is a replacement for Zoo Tycoon 2's old splash image. This new image was created by Dragranzer and will be seen every time you load up Zoo Tycoon 2. Before you place this one in the main Zoo Tycoon 2 directory, place the old one of the same filename somewhere in your computer where you'll remember it. Once that is out of the way, place the new file in the following path: 

`C\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2`

Known Issues


The animals do not have sick or dirty skins. Some of the animals may have odd animations or light distortion but that is due to the low number of vertices in the model and the bones they are using.
