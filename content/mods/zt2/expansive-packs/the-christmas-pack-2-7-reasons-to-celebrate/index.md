Context
=

Although Z-Studio is primarily known for its Paranoia! expansion pack themed around cryptids and other spooky content, the team produced other downloads as well, including this one. The Christmas Packs were a duo of premium packs for Zoo Tycoon 2 with a theme around Christmas and Hannukkah. One was produced in 2008, the other in 2009.

This download requires its first part, [The Christmas Pack](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/expansive-packs/the-christmas-pack/>).

=
Known issues
=

- The Zoopedia articles don't work for the holly hedge, low holly, Christmas themed tank wall, and opaque Christmas themed tank wall.
- Parts of the sides of the regular gift box can sometimes be see-through. This seems to happen if you place too many of them too close together.
