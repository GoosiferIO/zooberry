Context
=

Although Z-Studio is primarily known for its Paranoia! expansion pack themed around cryptids and other spooky content, the team produced other downloads as well, including this one. The Christmas Packs were a duo of premium packs for Zoo Tycoon 2 with a theme around Christmas and Hannukkah. One was produced in 2008, the other in 2009.

Known issues
=

- The Zoopedia article doesn't work for the low Christmas fence and windowed Christmas fence.
- The elf reskin for hirable staff didn't work during testing. Only vendors for the Christmas diner, as well as the plum pudding snack cart from Part 2, will use an elf skin.
