This is part of a set of eight biome packs that were made by the Zoo Admin Design Team many years ago. Many members helped out. Please note that due to how old these packs are, not everything is up to the same standard that Penguinman would have later used. Modeling, for instance, was not discovered until after these packs were made. However, Penguinman did feel that many of the plants, objects and animals would be useful and that's why he reuploaded them onto Penguin's Peak. Hope you enjoy!

Context
=

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with other users. Each animal includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Known issues
=

- Potentially as a side effect of using a different rig than the males, the female nilgai don't properly fulfill their social needs. They don't get too unhappy over this though.
- Additionally, while not outright a bug, the female nilgai is more finnicky about fulfilling its thirst needs than is typical. It could potentially not be able to drink from the food trough, again because of its base animal differing from the males. If you place down fresh water bowls when they complain, that can help mitigate this issue. If they still complain about water, try giving them a natural water source.
