title: Temperate Forest Pack
---
This is part of a set of eight biome packs that were made by the Zoo Admin Design Team many years ago. Many members helped out. Please note that due to how old these packs are, not everything is up to the same standard that Penguinman would have later used. Modeling, for instance, was not discovered until after these packs were made. However, Penguinman did feel that many of the plants, objects and animals would be useful and that's why he reuploaded them onto Penguin's Peak. Hope you enjoy!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with other users. Each animal includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Known issues
=

- The adult eastern blue tongued skinks are so small and so slow, that creating an exhibit small enough for them to fulfill their needs fast enough would be quite difficult.
- While not outright a bug, the wombat is more finnicky about fulfilling its hunger and thirst needs than is typical. It seems to prioritize other tasks over eating or drinking. If you place down fresh food or water when they complain, that can help mitigate this issue. If they still complain about water, try giving them a natural water source.
- During certain animations such as self-grooming, the wombat will climb up into the air as if it were a koala climbing a tree.
- The English oak has no map location in-game.
