A pack containing 15 Cretaceous era, JPOG styled dinosaurs. 


This Pack Includes:


- Alectrosaurus
- Centrosaurus
- Charonosaurus
- Leptoceratops
- Maiasaura
- Nemegtosaurus
- Olorotitan
- Ornithomimus
- Oviraptor
- Parksosaurus
- Pentaceratops
- Saurolophus
- Shantungosaurus
- Tarbosaurus
- Tarchia

There's also reskins of the dinosaurs included in BioHazard's Operation Genesis - Part 2 pack. These include reskins of:

- Albertosaurus
- Ankylosaurus
- Corythosaurus
- Edmontosaurus
- Gallimimus
- Homalocephale
- Pachycephalosaurus
- Parasaurolophus
- Styracosaurus
- Torosaurus
- Triceratops
- Tyrannosaurus rex
- Velociraptor

This download will function without the aforementioned pack, but you won't see these reskins in game without both mods present in your game folder. In order to get the reskins to show over the other skins, please add a few z's at the beginning of the Charming Cretaceous z2f's file name in order for the reskins to take priority.


Known issues:


- All dinosaurs are white until placed.
- Several dinosaurs are missing zoopedias and some locations without a default corresponding icon are white.
- The Centrosaurus lang is incorrectly formatted, and will have no name in game.
- Leptoceratops glows and is not affected by in game lighting. Food also gets stuck in its mouth after eating.
- Alectrosaurus nests will crash the game when hatching.
- All of the hadrosaurs will mate and get pregnant, but will not actually lay eggs. Their pregnancy status disappears as if they had laid one, though.
- Tarbosaurus will mate and make a nest, but the baby will be frozen when it hatches.
- If you download this pack without Biohazard's Operation Genesis - Part 2 pack also, the reskins will not be applied, and while the filter text will be incorrectly shown it can still be selected.

The models will appear to have holes in them, this is intentional to an extent. Older JPOG mods often used transparent parts of the texture to 'erase' bits of the mesh before custom models became a thing, and as such these skins applied to the imported models have the same effect."
