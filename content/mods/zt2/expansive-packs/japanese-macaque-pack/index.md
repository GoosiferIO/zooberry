summary: Japanese macaques range through the forested mountains and highlands of Japan.
title: Japanese Macaque Pack
---
Japanese macaques range through the forested mountains and highlands of Japan. They occupy the northernmost regions of any nonhuman primate and are subject to large seasonal variation in climate, as is typical of northern latitudes. In the central and northern parts of Japan, temperatures can range from -15 C in the winter to 23 C in the summer. These large swings in temperature may explain why Japanese macaques have different home ranges in different seasons.
