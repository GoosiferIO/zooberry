> We are preparing to embark upon an excursion to travel the oceans in search of tropical paradise! We hope to sail away into the tropics and discover the isles hiding within. The Hawaiian Islands and Papua New Guinea are just a few of the places we plan to explore, seeing such animals as the Hawaiian Monk Seal and the Northern Cassowary as they live in their lush and vibrant homes. We will be documenting our trips and showing you all of the wondrous plants and animals we see.
