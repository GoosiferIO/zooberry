This is part of a set of eight biome packs that were made by the Zoo Admin Design Team many years ago. Many members helped out. Please note that due to how old these packs are, not everything is up to the same standard that Penguinman would have later used. Modeling, for instance, was not discovered until after these packs were made. However, Penguinman did feel that many of the plants, objects and animals would be useful and that's why he reuploaded them onto Penguin's Peak. Hope you enjoy!

Context
=

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with other users. Each animal includes a gift for guests to purchase. Additionally, as it was created before Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals or the Dino Danger Pack premium download, the Pyrenean ibex uses the Critically Endangered conservation status rather than the Extinct one.

=
Known issues
=

- The Verreaux's frog doesn't mate or breed at all. However, unlike the other frogs coded by Penguinman, it didn't seem to have any issues with fulfilling its needs.
- The icon of the fences' gates is a white square, but you would only see it if you go out of your way to select it.
