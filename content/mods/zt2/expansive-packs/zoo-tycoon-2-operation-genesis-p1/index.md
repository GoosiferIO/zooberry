Known issues


- Some of the 3D preview icons are way too big and spill out from the box.
- The information boards and feeders do not show up under the filter for this pack. They seem to show up under a seperate filter which is missing some strings, but it can still be selected.
- Placing too many bins next to eachother causes one of them to distort.
- Not exactly a bug but more of an oversight, the gift kiosk is set to use rare gifts, so the only dinosaur related gifts guests will buy from it are the Carnotaurus and Styracosaurus gifts. They don't seem to buy from it anyway.
- Guests also seem to not want to buy anything at the food kiosk other than the burger.
