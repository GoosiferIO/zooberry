title: Grassland Pack
---
This is part of a set of eight biome packs that were made by the Zoo Admin Design Team many years ago. Many members helped out. Please note that due to how old these packs are, not everything is up to the same standard that Penguinman would have later used. Modeling, for instance, was not discovered until after these packs were made. However, Penguinman did feel that many of the plants, objects and animals would be useful and that's why he reuploaded them onto Penguin's Peak. Hope you enjoy!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with other users. Each animal includes a gift for guests to purchase.

Known issues
=

- The skins of the Aldabra tortoise and Mongolian wild donkey are black before placement in the preview window. The skin appears as expected within the actual game world however.
- The Aldabra tortoise's eggs are invisible. Additionally, they took exceptionally long to hatch during testing. Although they did eventually hatch, it was well after the hatch timer had turned red.
- The young elk lacks an icon, so a white square shows up in place of one.
- The Pampas grass has no map location in-game.
- The Safari and Jungle themed versions of the Iced Tea Stand are nameless.
