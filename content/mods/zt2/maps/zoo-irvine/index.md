languages:
---

This zoo basically has 7 different sections: Amazon; Worldwide Coasts; Indian Wonders; Amazing Australia; an Owl aviary; and a Costa Rican house (not finished due to problem mentioned above). Each section has anywhere from 7-10 species of animals and usually consists of some sort of small animal house, an avairy or two, and a couple large, outdoor yards.

You need a lot of downloads, but I think the most basic ones you need are all of the downloads from Zeta-Designs; Snowleo's Combi-Patch; European Expeditions; All of the Fauna del Mundo packs by Hispa-Designs; Reptilia; Aves; World of Imports II; Pokey's Snake Packs; Radical Remake 2; AD's Packs; and any other downloads you don't have that I didn't mention, you can just fill in yourself: Be Creative!
