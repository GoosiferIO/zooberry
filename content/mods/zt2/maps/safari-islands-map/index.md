Zoo Safari Islands Map - Exhibit : Guest area, animals none. 

A little more information:
This zoo, called "Safari Islands Map" is only a map. It consists of a number of wild (in the meaning of not changed from what they used to be) savannah islands with paths, fenced guests paths, and 4 guest areas between the island. One big food court at the entrance, a few smaller areas on other places (not built yet). Your task is to build the map up now. You will easily recognize guest and animal areas. Map suitable for yafi zoos.  In fact you could say the guests are fenced in on this map, not the animals lol
I made this one quickly during a little bit of square time during the exams .. took me about  an hour (usually a zoo takes me 3-4 hours).

Hope you will like the map.

Greetings,
