This pack contains six freeform template maps on which you can build your zoos. Five are completely blank, flat, featureless expanses ideal for grid-based zoos and for starting from scratch. The sixth contains six exhibit spaces clearly marked out and a handsome entrance already built.

None of these zoos should be used by anyone who likes to keep track of money and time in Freeform. Both have been ignored in the creation of these zoos.
