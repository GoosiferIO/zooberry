summary: A hack that modifies the biome objects from Extinct Animals.
title: EA Biome Objects Hack
---
This download takes the three new 'biome objects' from Extinct Animals - the Tar Pit, Misty Spring and Glacier - and resizes them 'so they aren't so excruciatingly huge'. It also allows animals from the Boreal Forest environment- which encompasses both Mesozoic and Cenozoic creatures ingame- to use either the Spring or Glacier, so that the Spring can be used for dinosaurs and the Glacier for the Cenozoic animals associated with the 'Ice Age'.

Additionally, the Tar Pit is renamed to 'Heater', Misty Spring to 'Humidifier' and Glacier to 'Cooler'.

This download has no known issues.
