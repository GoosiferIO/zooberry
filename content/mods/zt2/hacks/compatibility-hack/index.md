Description:  This hack makes all the ZT2, ES, AA and MM animals, plus the black panther, the asian elephant, the musk ox and the addax 100% comfortable in any biome and with any space. On top of that, it makes the ratel and Ethiopian wolf odorfree, makes the Nile monitor less likely to get attacked by Komodo dragons and the white rhino a bit bigger. The perfect hack for the lovers of mixed exibits of any kind.

Compatibility:  Tested only with all exp. installed, so this requires ZT2:MM. 

Side Notes:  Aim and myself tested it, and it works correctly in the Spanish version. Angilas44 had some problems with the Polar bear when testing, but I looked into it and I belive it's corected. It has to be placed in the main ZT2 folder. The changes won't show up in animals already existant when this was downloaded.
