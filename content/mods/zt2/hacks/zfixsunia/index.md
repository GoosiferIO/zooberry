This hack fixes hippos, pigs (warthogs), and peccaries to not chew their cud. This is because Blue Fang coded rumination as a behavior for all members of Artiodactyla, while these specific groups don't ruminate in real life. A much more detailed explanation of the 'how' and 'why' behind this hack can be found in ReadMe.txt included in the .zip file.
