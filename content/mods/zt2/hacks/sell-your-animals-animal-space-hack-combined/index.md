# This hack allows you to:  
1. Sell animals (using "put up for adoption") for 80% of their purchase price.  
2. Reduce space requirements for MM2 animals to 1 square each.  

# Installation
1. place the enclosed .z2f files in your zoo tycoon 2 directory folder usually `c:/program files/microsoft games/zoo tycoon 2`
2. if you only have zt2 then only put in X900_100.z2f
3. for ES use x900.000.z2f
4. for AA use x910_000.z2f AND X901_000.Z2F
