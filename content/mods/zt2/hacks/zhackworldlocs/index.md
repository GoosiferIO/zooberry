This hack adds a bit of flavor to the globe by spreading out the Tundra zoos (ANWR, Canada, Siberia, etc.) and moving the Polar Coast zoo to the coast. A much more detailed explanation of the 'how' and 'why' behind this hack can be found in ReadMe.txt included in the .zip file. This explanation includes extensive instructions on how designers could make similar changes themselves.

The Tundra zoos are now as follows:
- Polar Coast: Located near Scott Base on Antarctica
- Tundra Small: Located near Repulse Bay in Canada
- Tundra Med: Located near Yakutsk in Siberia
- Tundra Large: Located in ANWR (near Kaktovik), in Alaska
- Tundra Ice Chasm: Not moved, but the name is now Greenland
