This is the same as the other compatibility hack but also includes support for the Extinct Animals expansion pack, so only one is needed in your game.

Compatibility:  ZT2, ES, AA, MM, EA. 

Description:  This makes all official ZT2 animals, sans exception, be comfortable in any biome and with any space (incluiding the Quagga and T3H KILL4 P3NGU1N). It also makes better sized the White rhino, Utahraptor, Tyrannosaurus, Tylacine, Deinosuchus and whale shark. Also gets rid of the odor of the ratel and Ethiopian wolf.
