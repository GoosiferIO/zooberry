This hack unlocks the Endangered Species theme objects.  

**How to use:**  
1. Place the file into your saved games folder (`C:/Documents and Settings/YOURUSERNAME/Application Data/Microsoft Games/Zoo Tycoon 2/Default Profile/Saved`).  
2. Open the file, find the last photo of a Spectacled Bear eating a papaya plant, and you'll unlock the theme objects.
