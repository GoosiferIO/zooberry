As described by the [ZT2 Download Library](https://zt2downloadlibrary.fandom.com/wiki/CombiPatch_(Snowleo)):

    - Allows you to delete the zoo entrance and place a zoo tile in its place (guests still enter the zoo if it's open).
    - Changes the zoo walls into hedge fences.
    - Allows free placement (non-grid) of rocks and foliage.
    - Allows zooming out farther away with the camera.
    - Elevated paths can be placed much lower.
    - Combines all default food stands into a single food stand, and all default drink stands into a single drink stand.
    - Makes rocks, foliage and fences unselectable.

Companion patches that address the unselectable objects are also available:
