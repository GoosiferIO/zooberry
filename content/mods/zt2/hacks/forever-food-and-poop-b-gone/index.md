Keeps food bowls full and eliminates poop!  
There are 3 separate hacks in this download file:  

**Hack #1 - Forever Food**  
This hack enables food dishes to always remain full, working for both food and water.  

**Hack #2 - PoopBGone**  
Stops all animals from peeing and pooping, keeping exhibits clean.  

**Hack #3 - Forever Food and PoopBGone Combo Hack**  
Combines both hacks into one file for convenience. Instructions are included in each zip file.

This hack was made with the patch and all available free Official Bonus Content Installed. Enjoy!

> There are two versions of this hack: one for Zoo Tycoon 2 and one that support animals in Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species as well. If you have the expansion pack, only the ES version is needed.
