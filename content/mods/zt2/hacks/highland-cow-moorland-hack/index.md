summary: Moves the highland cow to the Moorland biome.
title: Highland Cow Moorland Hack
---
This hack moves the highland cow from ShenTirag's [European Pack I](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/animals/animal-bundles/european-pack-i//>) to the user-made [Moorland](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/biomes/moorland/>) biome. It will require both the biome and the original pack in order to work properly.
