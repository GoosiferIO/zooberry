summary: "Allows zoo keepers to feed and water animals manually."
---
This hack lets zoo keepers manually feed and water animals by reducing hunger and thirst to zero.  

# Important Notes
- Only works for the initial animals (not giraffes or lemurs).  
- Requires modifying game files.  
- Only compatible with ZT2 without any expansions.  

# Installation 
1. Place the `lang.z2f` file into the dictionary folder to enable feed/water messages.  
2. Replace the AI file in the `entities` folder with the downloaded one (requires changing `entities` to a `.zip` on your desktop).  

> **Note by karlhall39:** THIS ONLY WORKS FOR ZT2 DOES NOT WORK IF YOU  HAVE ANY OF THE EXPANSIONS. ALSO MODIFYS GAME FILES SO USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
