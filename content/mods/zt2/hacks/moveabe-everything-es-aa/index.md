> Remember to back up your files before installing any hacks that modify game files in case you need to restore them.

This hack makes all in-game items, including Animal Shelters, Buildings, and Scenery, moveable. No more deleting and rebuying items to relocate them in your zoo. Note: This requires editing essential in-game files.

# Essential Information from the Original Board

> There are some hacks here that require you to edit entities.z2f for them to work.  Entities.z2f is an essential file that contains a lot of information crucial to the working of Zoo Tycoon 2.  It is highly recommended that you make a back-up of entities.z2f before using these hacks.  In many cases, there are updated versions that do not require you to edit this essential file, and it is therefore highly encouraged that you use updated versions instead.
