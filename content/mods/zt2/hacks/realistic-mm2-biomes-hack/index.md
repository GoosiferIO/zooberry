title: Realistic MM2 Biomes Hack
---
This hack adds more realistic foliage and rock details to the Marine Mania biomes (Benthic, Coastal, Pelagic and Reef). These details are only visible on medium or higher graphic settings. 

Simply drag and drop the zMMbiomes.z2f file into your main Zoo Tycoon 2 game folder (default location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2) and it should work.  To remove the hack at any time, simply move or delete the zMMbiomes.z2f file from the folder.
