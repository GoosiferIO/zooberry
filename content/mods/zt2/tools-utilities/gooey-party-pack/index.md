The ultimate pack for Gooey collectors! Giving you amazing new colours to experiment and play with, here is a list of what this pack contains:

- "Cherry Cola": A deep dark red, the colour you get when sunlight shines through a glass of cola
- "Ocean Spray": Give your game experience a splash of turquoise.
- "Strawberry Remix": A stunning colour update to my least favourite Gooey
- "Disco": Bring blue and pink to your game with a bit of bounce!

Bonus features included in this pack are:
- A catalogue of every Gooey released in a fun image
- "How to Use a Gooey" Guides, old version (Series 1-3) and new
- 3 bright and colourful logos
- 2 "Gooey Party Pack" wallpapers for your desktop in an oceanic disco theme

Thanks to Tigeress_10, kiwah, zoocrazy, okiewa, Zoo Crazy, Candypanda57, Zebu, bluerat313 and everyone else who commented and gave words of wisdom and support.

And extra special thanks to Budgielover101 and RedNotDead. Without your ideas, Budgie, the white and aqua Gooeys probably wouldn't have seen the light of day. And RND, for your constant feedback and helpful advice.

Thanks for downloading the 20th Gooey pack everybody, and remember that this isn't the last to come!
