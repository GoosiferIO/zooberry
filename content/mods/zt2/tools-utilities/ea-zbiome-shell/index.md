Extinct Animals zBiome Shell with support for ambients in user-made biomes.


Note by ZooBerry


It is unclear what this utility is doing that the original zBiome Shell does not do. The original zBiome Shell is a utility that allows users to create new biomes for Zoo Tycoon 2. The original file post does not provide a description, but the assumption here is that this version provides support for Extinct Animals biomes that perhaps the original did not. Your mileage may vary.
