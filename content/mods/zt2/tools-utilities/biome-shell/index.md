Alternatives have been released over the years, but this was the original modified biome system for Zoo Tycoon 2. It was created by Penguinman soon after Legosith (later known as Harlequinz eg0) started working on the first user-made biome, Abyss, for his cancelled Crazy Cephalopods expansion pack. The way it works is by adding 100 new 'slots,' with codenames numbered from zbiome1 to zbiome100, to Zoo Tycoon 2's biome selection UI. Many modders claimed biome slots for their own project ideas, however relatively few were completed. Many of those that were released can be found in the [biomes](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/biomes/>) section or in a few packs.

**This download has one known issue:**
- With this version of the download, the Dino Capture Team Bunker from Extinct Animals unfortunately disappears from the construction menu, and as a result becomes unplaceable.
