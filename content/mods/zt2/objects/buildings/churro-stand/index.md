A churro stand made by Goosifer (back when he used to go by Catc!) and Penguinman in 2009. Finally releasing in 2023! It includes a churro stand for every one of the base game theme stand models including:

- Safari
- Extinct
- Jungle
- Tundra
- Egyptian
- Default
- Endangered

Churros are a fun Mexican pastry with lots of sugar!
