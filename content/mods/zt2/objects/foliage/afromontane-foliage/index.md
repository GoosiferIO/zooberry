title: Afromontane Foliage
---
A set of trees from African mountains made to accompany the user-made [Montane Forest](<https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/biomes/montane-forest/>) biome! It will require the biome in order to work properly.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It has no known issues.
