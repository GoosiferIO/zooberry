Original Instructions by the Author 


**Installation**

Place the z2f-archive from the SZE-assortment directly in the Zoo Tycoon 2 directory or together with the corresponding dl-file in the Zoo Tycoon 2 download directory.

All downloads are packed in a zip archive. In the zip archive you will find the .z2f file that needs to be copied to the Zoo Tycoon 2 main directory. Together with special objects and object packs you will find an instruction manual and information in .txt, .htm or .html format. 

**Important**

- Don't change the names of the SZE-archives, because the Zoopedia-structure could become incorrect.
- SZE-archives are named continuously. Possible updates are arranged automatically in the right order. Every archive on its self is complete. In special occasions there is some information from the designer included in the download.

**Patches**

- The game should be free off patches or hacks from other designers. 
- All components of the SZE-Program match exactly in size and in texture with each other. 
- When using patches or hacks from other designers its not guaranteed that they work propperly.
- Patches and hacks from SZE can be used together with other SZE-downloads without problems, because they don't change the original files. 
- Objects from the SZE-assortiment are coded with appropriate features and made as independent files. 
- Patches and hacks from other designers could override these features, a realistic gameplay can't be guaranteed when those are used.
- Patches from the SZE-assortiment can be recognised by the SZE-number.
