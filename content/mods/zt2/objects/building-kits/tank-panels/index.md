Panels designed to look like the sides of a tank. These will be found purchasable from the Scenery tab in-game. 

Disclaimer: These are not fences, they are decorative objects that are designed to connect. They can be used to build new structures as pictured and perhaps even to embellish existing ones as described by the author.
