Guests will love this mini form of the volcano, especially when it is erupting steam. It was designed by Samemo for the Object Recolor Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 04/21/2006 and the winners were announced on 06/07. This particular download received a runner up position!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues.
