This is a scenery pack from the creative minds of Penguinman and Budgielover101. Bring a fantastical element to your zoo decorations.

Included in this pack:
- Air Orb
- Blood Fountain
- Dark Arch
- Light Arch
- Earch Bench
- Electricity Binoculars
- Fire Fountain
- Flora Box (donation box)
- Death Lamp
- Metal Path
- Poison Pool
- Shadow

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user.

**This download has one known issue:**
- Parts of the skins of the fire fountain and poison fountain are black before placement in the preview window. The skins appear as expected within the actual game world however.
