summary: "A table made of stone for guests to eat on."
---
A table made of stone for guests to eat on. It was designed by catc (now known as Goosifer) for the Object Recolor Contest at ZT2DC, and was hosted there as an exclusive download. The contest was announced on 04/21/2006 and the winners were announced on 06/07. This particular download received a runner up position!

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman coded for another user. It has no known issues. For whatever reason it overwrites the textures of Nintendo_6444's Endangered Picnic Table from the same contest though.
