---
This download was created as a collaboration between many members for the first Skinning Collage event at ZT2DC. The event was organized by Mikaboshi and announced on 01/15/2009. She divided the base skin into several parts, and sent each participant one section each.

Mysty skinned the lanterns, koala_pear skinned the floors and railings, DinosaurMan (now known as Hendrix) skinned the roofing, ShenTirag skinned the posts and borders, and finally CrazyPeafowl skinned the gazebo top.

Once all of the sections were finished, Mika put them back together to create the final skin. Lastly it was coded by none other than Penguinman. The final result is a colorful gazebo full of lime green and kookaburras, a perfect match for the site that it originated from. This download has no known issues.
