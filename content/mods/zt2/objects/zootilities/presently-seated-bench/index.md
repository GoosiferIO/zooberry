This bench is  a great place for your guests to eat candy canes or sip hot cocoa in your zoo. They also are great for any other occasion where guests need a place to sit.
Created by Arundell/DTF95 and meshed by Artifex (Catc and Penguinman).

Context

Years ago, probably around the year 2009, we ran a contest through an event we called ZooLive. I believe the idea was that if a user guessed our secret project correctly they get to collaborate on a project with Artifex, something simple. This was the result.

Textured and designed by DTF95, model by Goosifer (then Catc), XML configuration and Nif tweaks by Penguinman.

Feel free to make your own derivative projects with the model and XML configuration. You'd just need a new texture since we do not know DTF95's wishes about his texture.
