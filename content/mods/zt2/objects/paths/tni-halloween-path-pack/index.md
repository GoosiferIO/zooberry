**T'ni's Halloween Path Collection, 2006**  

It was a dark and stormy night...  
:insert lightning, quickly followed by a very loud crash of thunder here:  

I jumped in my time machine to Halloween Eve. The full moon was just rising as I sat down with a big pot of coffee and booted up Adobe PhotoShop (v5.5). I distorted textures till dawn and picked out the best... just for you.  

I hope you're not too scared.
