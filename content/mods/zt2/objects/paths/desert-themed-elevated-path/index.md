Part of a set of elevated paths made to match the vanilla game's building themes, in this case the Desert Theme from African Adventure. This path would be perfect for giving guests an elevated view of North African exhibits.

Unlike most other downloads by Penguinman, this one was created solely by himself. It has no known issues.
