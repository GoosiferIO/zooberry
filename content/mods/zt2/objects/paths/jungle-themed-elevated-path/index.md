Part of a set of elevated paths made to match the vanilla game's building themes, in this case the Jungle Theme from base Zoo Tycoon 2. This path would be perfect for giving guests an elevated view of Tropical Rainforest exhibits.

Unlike most other downloads by Penguinman, this one was created solely by himself. It has no known issues.
