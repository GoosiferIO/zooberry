title: Extinct Themed Elevated Path
---
Part of a set of elevated paths made to match the vanilla game's building themes, in this case the Extinct Theme from Extinct Animals. This path would be perfect for giving guests an elevated view of your animals from a bygone era.

Like many other downloads of its time, this was a collaboration that Penguinman created with another user. It has no known issues.
