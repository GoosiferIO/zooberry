Part of a set of elevated paths made to match the vanilla game's building themes, in this case the Tundra Theme from official bonus downloads. This path would be perfect for giving guests an elevated view of polar exhibits.

Unlike most other downloads by Penguinman, this one was created solely by himself. It has no known issues.
