This dinosaur fence is perfect for large dinosaurs. There are also two smaller dinosaur fences, a vehicle gate and placeable cables. With these objects you can make a gate construction for Jeeps or zookeepers.


Issues


- This fence was coded with Spanish language codes, so the Zoopedia entries won't show in the English version of the game. However, the strings themselves are in English, so this might have been a mistake.
