You can watch it on Youtube. It is in German, but the visuals should be helpful.\n=== Instructions Snowleo\u0026rsquo;s instructions roughly translated from German:\nEditing Platform\nThis platform is needed for precise placement of roofs from the SZE range. Description in Zoopedia. Snowleo\u0026rsquo;s Zoo Equipment\nWhen using objects from the SZE range, \u0026ldquo;Zoo Tycoon 2\u0026rdquo; and the expansion packs \u0026ldquo;African Adventure\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Endangered Species\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Marine Mania\u0026rdquo; should be installed. Installation: Copy z2f archives from the SZE range directly into the Zoo Tycoon 2 program directory or along with the corresponding download file into the Zoo Tycoon 2 download directory. All downloads are packed in a zip archive. In this zip archive, you will find the z2f archive to be copied into the Zoo Tycoon 2 program directory. For special objects and object kits, you will also find assembly instructions and information in .txt, .htm, or .html format. Important: Do not rename original SZE archives, otherwise, the Zoopedia structure will not be displayed correctly. SZE archives have a continuous file naming. Possible updates automatically arrange themselves in the exact order. Each archive is complete in itself. In special cases, information from the manufacturer is included with the download. Patches: The game should be free of patches or hacks from other manufacturers. All components from the SZE program are very precisely manufactured in size and texture and can be positioned exactly in combination with each other. When using patches from other manufacturers, this feature is no longer guaranteed. Patches from Snowleo\u0026rsquo;s Zoo Equipment can be used without concern as they do not change the properties of the base objects. Objects from the SZE range are encoded as independent files with appropriate properties. Patches from other manufacturers can overwrite these properties so that no realistic gameplay is guaranteed. Patches from the SZE range are recognizable by the SZE number.

They are native to Exmoor, a large area of moorland in the counties of Devon and Cornwall. They are more genetically pure than their relatives, the Dartmoor pony, and are therefore more similar in their physical appearances. Their hardy nature means that they will eat poor quality grazing and by grazing over a wide area, spread biodiversity in their region.

Several dinosaurs are missing zoopedias and some locations without a default corresponding icon are white. The Centrosaurus lang is incorrectly formatted, and will have no name in game. Leptoceratops glows and is not affected by in game lighting. Food also gets stuck in its mouth after eating. Alectrosaurus nests will crash the game when hatching. All of the hadrosaurs will mate and get pregnant, but will not actually lay eggs. Their pregnancy status disappears as if they had laid one, though. Tarbosaurus will mate and make a nest, but the baby will be frozen when it hatches. If you download this pack without Biohazard\u0026rsquo;s Operation Genesis - Part 2 pack also, the reskins will not be applied, and while the filter text will be incorrectly shown it can still be selected. The models will appear to have holes in them, this is intentional to an extent.

Please contact AubreyKitsune or Goosifer if you manage to find it!\n=== Included in the Download Animals:\nKannemeyeria Prosictodon Robertia Uralokannemeyeria ==== Credits Bunyupy for the base model. ==== Known issues This pack is buggy as it has several detected issues. Robertia and Uralokannemeyeria are the least affected in a gameplay sense and are generally functional. Kannemeyeria and Prosictodon\u0026rsquo;s issues are more impactful, so be mindful if you decide to use them.\nThis download\u0026rsquo;s known issues are:\nAll four animals lack an icon, so a white square shows up in place of one. Kannemeyeria, Prosictodon, and Robertia are white before placement, but their skins appear as expected afterwards. Kannemeyeria and Uralokannemeyeria lack Zoopedia articles. Kannemeyeria and Prosictodon have no map location in-game. There is a strange quirk with the coding where Kannemeyeria is coded as \u0026ldquo;Pachyrhinosaurus,\u0026rdquo; Robertia is coded as \u0026ldquo;Nutria,\u0026rdquo; and Uralokannemeyeria is coded as \u0026ldquo;Centrosaurus.\u0026rdquo; This means that they will conflict with animals with the same codename. Although Prosictodon has both a Zoopedia article and a correct codename, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as a \u0026ldquo;European Beaver\u0026rdquo; in said article. Even though they will mate, Kannemeyeria and Prosictodon have bugged reproduction. They will \u0026ldquo;build a nest\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;give birth\u0026rdquo; respectively without any nests, eggs, or offspring appearing. Instead, the mother\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy status is removed without effect. This issue won\u0026rsquo;t appear naturally in gameplay due to the reproduction issue, but young Kannemeyeria forced through Thom\u0026rsquo;s cheat codes will have a young Triceratops model with a mismatched skin. Kannemeyeria were bad about fulfilling their needs during testing, particularly Privacy, and were prone to rampaging because of it.

The changes won\u0026rsquo;t show up in animals already existant when this was downloaded.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/hacks/guest-limit-hack/","title":"Guest Limit Hack","body":"Contains three different files for different guest limits and a readme file. \u0026mdash;- Compatibility: ZT2 + All Expansions \u0026mdash;- Short Description: Have you ever gotten tired of only a certain amount of guests in your zoo? Here is the resource to change that.\nInstructions: Copy the desired Z2F file into the folder where Zoo Tycoon 2 is installed.\nComes in 3 different \u0026lsquo;strengths\u0026rsquo; - the number indicates the new guest limit. Unlike the default guest limit, this limit is not affected by zoo fame.\nDeveloper notes (warning: contains math):\nThe MaxGuestsBase and MaxGuestsPerStar values in the guestMgr.xml control the guest limit. MaxGuestsBase is the guest limit for a half-star zoo; MaxGuestsPerStar is the increase to the guest limit for each star (half stars count half) in addition to that half star. In other words:\nL = b + p(s - .5)\nwhere L = guest limit, b = MaxGuestsBase, p = MaxGuestsPerStar, s = number of stars of fame in the zoo.\nThe default settings are MaxGuestsBase = 30 and MaxGuestsPerStar = 20, yielding a limit of 120 guests for a five-star zoo.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/alpine-viewing-area/","title":"Alpine Viewing Area","body":"The Alpine Viewing Area was designed by Zooasaurus for the 2008 Coliseum Tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/zootilities/alpine-geological-model/","title":"Alpine Geological Model","body":"Designed by Otter Lord for the ZooMania Coliseum Tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/markhor-fountain/","title":"Markhor Fountain","body":"The markhor fountain was designed by King Hoopla for the ZooMania Coliseum Tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/forgotten-spire/","title":"Forgotten Spire","body":"The Forgotten Spire was designed by Catc for the 2008 Coliseum Tournament.\nThe 3D model was created and textured by Catc and is released under Creative Commons: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/ibex-arch/","title":"Ibex Arch","body":"Ibex arch designed by badisbadis101 for the ZooMania Coliseum tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/atlantis-viewing-area/","title":"Atlantis Viewing Area","body":"An Atlantis-themed viewing canopy designed by Otter Lord for the Coliseum Tournament at ZooMania in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/enlarged-desert-fountain/","title":"Enlarged Desert Fountain","body":"This fountain is a larger version of the one found in AA.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/snow-volcano/","title":"Snow Volcano","body":"A volcano with a snowy peak.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/small-gemstone-pack/","title":"Small Gemstone Pack","body":"Includes:\nSmall Tourmaline Deposit Small Topaz Deposit Small Sapphire Deposit Small Ruby Deposit Small Quartz Deposit Small Jade Deposit Small Amethyst Deposit Small Amber Deposit "},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/paths/shens-path-pack/","title":"Shen's Path Pack","body":"Includes:\nYellow brick path Wicker path Red brick path Rain rock path Marble path Leafy path Gravel path Crazy path Cracked mud path Cobble path Atlantis path Aratile path "},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/glass-fence/","title":"Glass Fence","body":"This is the an all glass fence created by Gibbon-Fanatic with help from Penguinman.

Try these out and see which works for you.\nTable of Contents Important Installing Entity Mods Lang Files Installing Zoos Installing Scenarios Questions? Important Turn off the game: Though it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cause any issues if we were to install a mod while your game is running, it makes sense to have it shut down so that any changes show up on a re-launch. Unzip your files: All files on ZooBerry are in .zip format and will require access to a zip utility. Below are resources that can get you started. Zipping/Unzipping files with the default Windows zip utility Zipping/Unzipping files with 7-Zip Download 7-Zip How to use 7-Zip Installing Entity Mods An entity in Zoo Tycoon can be described as any animal or object (buildings, foliage, etc). Installing custom entities in Zoo Tycoon 1 is easy and amounts to a simple drag and drop.\nFirst, go to the ZT1 root folder.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\\nIf you have a dlupdate folder, drop your .ztd file there:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\dlupdate\nIf you do not have a dlupdate folder, drop your .ztd file into the Updates folder instead:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Updates\nThe install directory changes depending on the version of the game you own but these instructions should be consistent.\nLang Files Importantly, Zoo Tycoon mods will often add new UI strings, things like guest thoughts, zoopedia entries, and other additions that require the inclusion of a .dll file in your installation process. This .dll file serves as a serialized data container with most of the strings in the game. Community nomenclature has dubbed these files \u0026rsquo;lang files\u0026rsquo; because they are always prefixed by the \u0026rsquo;lang\u0026rsquo; identifier.\nIf your mod requires a lang file, simply download the referenced version in the mod instruction blurb, extract the .dll file, and drop it into the root Zoo Tycoon game directory:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\\nNote: Not all ZT1 mods make use of lang files.\nInstalling Zoos .zoo files are the Zoo Tycoon 1 save file format and is used for both the zoo maps themselves after saving the game and for scenarios.\nTo install a zoo save file, drop it into the following directory:\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Saved Games\nInstalling Scenarios If you happen to have a copy of one of the few custom scenarios and wish to install it, simply drop the .zoo file in the following directory. Any accompanying .ztd and lang files are installed the same as explained above.\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Maps\nQuestions?

Zipping/Unzipping files with the default Windows zip utility Zipping/Unzipping files with 7-Zip Download 7-Zip How to use 7-Zip Method 1 Method 1 is the easiest way to install mods and amounts to a simple drag and drop. Place your extracted .z2f files in here:\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Zoo Tycoon 2\nMethod 2 Many legacy mods from ZooMania and the Zoo Tycoon 2 Design Centre contain .dl files alongside the main mod files. These files were usually included because they credited the mod author and allowed for the mod to appear as a \u0026lsquo;download\u0026rsquo; within Zoo Tycoon 2. This section is a bit more involved, but is still worth understanding if you wish to have the original mods set up the way they were originally meant to be seen. It is also a great method because it allows to organize your mods a bit more within subdirectories. See ahead for details.\nPlease note that this does require displaying hidden files on Windows, so if this is a non-negotiable option to you, feel free to stick to the above install method.\nStep 1 Folders are hidden on Windows by default. We need to make them visible to see the install directory.\nTo display hidden files and folders on Windows XP, Windows 7\nOpen Folder Options in Control Panel. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Click Appearance and Themes, and then click Folder Options. On the View tab, under Hidden files and folders, click Show hidden files and folders. To display hidden files and folders on modern Windows systems\nOpen a File Explorer window In the submenu up top, click on View \u0026gt; Show \u0026gt; Hidden Items Step 2 Drop your .dl files inside of the following directory:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon 2\\downloads\\zootycoon_com_zt2_1033\nThis directory should already be populated if you have official DLC installed.\nStep 3 Drop your .z2f files into any one of the folders denoted by a four-digit number.\nInstalling Zoos and Maps Zoos and maps are essentially save files and will go into the save folder. Open up a File Explorer on Windows and enter the following line into the address bar:\n%appdata%\nThis will convert into a proper file-system address that will have several folders named after applications installed on your computer. From here, go to the following path:\nMicrosoft Games \u0026gt; Zoo Tycoon 2 \u0026gt; Default Profile \u0026gt; Saved\nThis is where you will drop your .z2f save file.\nQuestions?

Often the licenses would say \u0026ldquo;public domain\u0026rdquo; if the author was open to derivative mods based on their work. However, \u0026ldquo;public domain\u0026rdquo; has a very clear definition under US copyright law that we would rather not get into, especially since modding in general implies modification of proprietary game assets.\nWhen browsing mods on ZooBerry, you will find a field that says \u0026ldquo;Does the author allow derivate mods?\u0026rdquo;, the answers will be one of the following:\nYes No Unknown If yes, the author has expressed at some point that people can use the published files as a base to create a derivative mod. If no, then this permission has not been given. If unknown, the author never made their wishes public and therefore should be treated as a no.\nOther licenses If a mod author created their own art assets from scratch (3D models, textures, etc), the license given will be available in the mod description. These licenses range anywhere from Creative Commons to MIT, depending on the author and the work it covers.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in publishing your mod to ZooBerry and you made your own assets from scratch (they\u0026rsquo;re not a modified work from the base game files), you might consider using such a license.\nOpen Licenses MIT License For a comprehensive rundown of the MIT license, you can visit this resource: MIT License Rundown To access a copy of the MIT license that you can use for your own project (remember to customize the relevant sections), click here: MIT License Copy Other Open Source Licenses Please take the time to visit https://choosealicense.com/. It is designed specifically for someone who wishes to publish their work with a certain framework in mind and can help you get there quickly.\nQ\u0026amp;A Why use an open source license? There are numerous well-established licenses available. If you\u0026rsquo;re eager to share your work freely and encourage derivative works, it may be worth considering the benefits of protecting your hard work within the boundaries you wish to establish, even within the open-source community.\nWhat if you don\u0026rsquo;t pick a license? That\u0026rsquo;s okay! If you don\u0026rsquo;t choose a license, your work is automatically protected by copyright law and remains yours. However, not declaring a license implies that your work is not open source and not available for derivative works. Most of the legacy mods on ZooBerry were released before modders started specifying licenses, resulting in these works remaining closed. On that note, if we mislabeled a mod as closed and it is in fact open, please let us know!\nIn Summary When choosing an open source license, remember that you are making a commitment to allow the public to use, modify, and distribute your work. It is essential to understand your chosen terms to avoid any potential miscommunication with your users.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/about/","title":"About","body":"Welcome to ZooBerry Table of Contents Welcome to ZooBerry Hi, Welcome. ZooBerry Will you backup legacy mods from other forums not from ZooMania, Northern Skies, or Artifex? I\u0026rsquo;m a current Zoo Tycoon modder. May I submit files to ZooBerry for hosting? Mod ownership Community Hi, Welcome. My name is Goosifer, but I used to go by other usernames. A long time ago I used to help run a couple of Zoo Tycoon websites named ZooMania and Northern Skies. I was also lucky to join a modding team named Artifex toward the very end of my time in the scene. Though I was incredibly young and still in high school, I consider it one of the coolest experiences and was able to learn a lot of fun tech while I explored my creative outlet online. In fact I think that Zoo Tycoon was a huge influence behind my decision to eventually study computer science.\nZooBerry ZooBerry is a recent idea and more or less came around when I \u0026rsquo;re-joined\u0026rsquo; the ZT modding scene some time in April 2023. I realized that all of the cool mods that my friends put together back in the day were no longer available anywhere. ZooMania never moved to Tapatalk and Northern Skies is slowly losing some of its files hosted through MediaFire and the like. I had a hand in running these websites back in the day and in Artifex\u0026rsquo;s case, was a freshman member of the team. I guess you can say I have a little stake in keeping them around a little longer.\nZooBerry was designed from the ground-up for Zoo Tycoon enthusiasts. Though it is in a usable state, many improvements are coming and I always welcome suggestions for new features.\nWill you backup legacy mods from other forums not from ZooMania, Northern Skies, or Artifex? As of November 2023, the scope of this project has grown from archiving mods from three websites, to nine. If you ran a Zoo Tycoon website or are a modder who wants their mods archived, please feel free to contact us. We are always open to adding additional libraries to the archive.\nThe current list of websites whose mods we are committed to hosting are as follows:\nZooMania Northern Skies Artifex ZT2 Designing Centre Penguika Penguin\u0026rsquo;s Peak Shen\u0026rsquo;s Den Zoo Tycoon Hideout Zoo Tycoon Volcano Z-Studio Bunyupy\u0026rsquo;s Projects Hispa Designs Dannybob\u0026rsquo;s Forum Stalker\u0026rsquo;s Ranch Mods from these websites are hosted with permission from the following website owners/responsible parties:\nPenguinman (Co-Founder, Team Member, Co-Owner): ZT2 Designing Centre, Artifex, Penguika, Penguin\u0026rsquo;s Peak ShenTirag (Owner, Team Member): Shen\u0026rsquo;s Den, Artifex Koala Komander (Founder, Co-Owner, Team Member): ZooMania, Artifex Goosifer (Team Member, Co-Owner, Co-Founder): ZooMania, Northern Skies, Artifex Incinerox (Owner): Zoo Tycoon Volcano JohnZTMaster (Owner, Founder, Co-Owner): Zoo Tycoon Hideout, ZT2 Designing Centre AubreyKitsune (Team Member, Current Leader): Z-Studio Bunyupy (Owner, Founder, Team Member): Bunyupy\u0026rsquo;s Projects, Hispa Designs Dannybob (Owner, Founder): Dannybob\u0026rsquo;s Forum, Stalker\u0026rsquo;s Ranch Note: roles in parantheses are not in any particular order.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a current Zoo Tycoon modder. May I submit files to ZooBerry for hosting? Absolutely. Although mod archival is the main motivation behind ZooBerry\u0026rsquo;s creation, I\u0026rsquo;d love for it to become a platform for current mods as well. Please check out the contact page for more information.\nMod ownership The original authors for mods hosted on ZooBerry have long moved on and are no longer in the Zoo Tycoon modding community. Whenever possible we have made effort to contact modders that are still around for permission to host their libraries, but when not available we contact the website owner that hosts their mods for permission to take over stewardship if the owner thinks it makes sense. (i.e. if file links are starting to break)\nZooBerry believes in mod ownership and therefore if you are author to a mod hosted here on ZooBerry and wish to have it taken down, please message us at zooberry@goosifer.io.\nCommunity ZooBerry has a forum component here: https://forums.zooberry.org/. It is mostly used to communicate website updates and to keep an open line of communication for anyone that has any questions about mods hosted on ZooBerry.\nFor other ZT forum communities around the internet, please see the links page.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/search/","title":"Search","body":"Search guide Use * asterisks before or after words to expand results.\nDo not use the asterisks if looking for exact words.\nSay we want to find anything with the word Ginger Simply search Ginger without asterisk if looking for Ginger Ging* will find Ginger or other words that start with Ging Ginger* won\u0026rsquo;t work.
