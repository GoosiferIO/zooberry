In order to get the reskins to show over the other skins, please add a few z\u0026rsquo;s at the beginning of the Charming Cretaceous z2f\u0026rsquo;s file name in order for the reskins to take priority.\n=== Known issues: All dinosaurs are white until placed. Several dinosaurs are missing zoopedias and some locations without a default corresponding icon are white. The Centrosaurus lang is incorrectly formatted, and will have no name in game. Leptoceratops glows and is not affected by in game lighting. Food also gets stuck in its mouth after eating. Alectrosaurus nests will crash the game when hatching. All of the hadrosaurs will mate and get pregnant, but will not actually lay eggs. Their pregnancy status disappears as if they had laid one, though. Tarbosaurus will mate and make a nest, but the baby will be frozen when it hatches. If you download this pack without Biohazard\u0026rsquo;s Operation Genesis - Part 2 pack also, the reskins will not be applied, and while the filter text will be incorrectly shown it can still be selected. The models will appear to have holes in them, this is intentional to an extent. Older JPOG mods often used transparent parts of the texture to \u0026rsquo;erase\u0026rsquo; bits of the mesh before custom models became a thing, and as such these skins applied to the imported models have the same effect.\u0026quot;\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/expansive-packs/zoo-tycoon-2-operation-genesis-p1/","title":"Zoo Tycoon 2: Operation Genesis - Part 1","body":"A pack containing various buildings, scenery and foliage imported from JPOG.\n=== Included Buildings\nFamily Restroom Food Kiosk Gift Kiosk Scenery\nCarnivore Feeder Cleaner Station Hatchery Herbivore Feeder Jurassic Park Bench Jurassic Park Fountain Jurassic Park Trashcan Land Cruiser Large Information Board Ranger Helicopter Ranger Station Rest Area Security Camera Sentry Turret Sentry Turret Base Small Information Board Speaker T-rex Tour Object Viewing Dome Viewing Dome Entrance Viewing Platform Visitor Helicopter Visitor Shelter Welcome Center Foliage\nCoconut Palm Fern Green Palm Large Jungle Palm Large Paleo Fern Large Paleo Tree Fern Medium Jungle Palm Medium Paleo Fern Medium Paleo Tree Fern Paleo Cyad Paleo Jungle Palm Paleo Palm Tree Sago Palm Small Jungle Palm Small Paleo Fern Small Paleo Tree Fern Tall Palm Other\nJurassic Park Path === Known issues Some of the 3D preview icons are way too big and spill out from the box.

Please contact AubreyKitsune or Goosifer if you manage to find it!\n=== Included in the Download Animals:\nKannemeyeria Prosictodon Robertia Uralokannemeyeria ==== Credits Bunyupy for the base model. ==== Known issues This pack is buggy as it has several detected issues. Robertia and Uralokannemeyeria are the least affected in a gameplay sense and are generally functional. Kannemeyeria and Prosictodon\u0026rsquo;s issues are more impactful, so be mindful if you decide to use them.\nThis download\u0026rsquo;s known issues are:\nAll four animals lack an icon, so a white square shows up in place of one. Kannemeyeria, Prosictodon, and Robertia are white before placement, but their skins appear as expected afterwards. Kannemeyeria and Uralokannemeyeria lack Zoopedia articles. Kannemeyeria and Prosictodon have no map location in-game. There is a strange quirk with the coding where Kannemeyeria is coded as \u0026ldquo;Pachyrhinosaurus,\u0026rdquo; Robertia is coded as \u0026ldquo;Nutria,\u0026rdquo; and Uralokannemeyeria is coded as \u0026ldquo;Centrosaurus.\u0026rdquo; This means that they will conflict with animals with the same codename. Although Prosictodon has both a Zoopedia article and a correct codename, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as a \u0026ldquo;European Beaver\u0026rdquo; in said article. Even though they will mate, Kannemeyeria and Prosictodon have bugged reproduction. They will \u0026ldquo;build a nest\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;give birth\u0026rdquo; respectively without any nests, eggs, or offspring appearing. Instead, the mother\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy status is removed without effect. This issue won\u0026rsquo;t appear naturally in gameplay due to the reproduction issue, but young Kannemeyeria forced through Thom\u0026rsquo;s cheat codes will have a young Triceratops model with a mismatched skin. Kannemeyeria were bad about fulfilling their needs during testing, particularly Privacy, and were prone to rampaging because of it.

In other words:\nL = b + p(s - .5)\nwhere L = guest limit, b = MaxGuestsBase, p = MaxGuestsPerStar, s = number of stars of fame in the zoo.\nThe default settings are MaxGuestsBase = 30 and MaxGuestsPerStar = 20, yielding a limit of 120 guests for a five-star zoo.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/alpine-viewing-area/","title":"Alpine Viewing Area","body":"The Alpine Viewing Area was designed by Zooasaurus for the 2008 Coliseum Tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/zootilities/alpine-geological-model/","title":"Alpine Geological Model","body":"Designed by Otter Lord for the ZooMania Coliseum Tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/markhor-fountain/","title":"Markhor Fountain","body":"The markhor fountain was designed by King Hoopla for the ZooMania Coliseum Tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/forgotten-spire/","title":"Forgotten Spire","body":"The Forgotten Spire was designed by Catc for the 2008 Coliseum Tournament.\nThe 3D model was created and textured by Catc and is released under Creative Commons: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/ibex-arch/","title":"Ibex Arch","body":"Ibex arch designed by badisbadis101 for the ZooMania Coliseum tournament in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/atlantis-viewing-area/","title":"Atlantis Viewing Area","body":"An Atlantis-themed viewing canopy designed by Otter Lord for the Coliseum Tournament at ZooMania in 2008.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/enlarged-desert-fountain/","title":"Enlarged Desert Fountain","body":"This fountain is a larger version of the one found in AA.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/snow-volcano/","title":"Snow Volcano","body":"A volcano with a snowy peak.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/scenery/small-gemstone-pack/","title":"Small Gemstone Pack","body":"Includes:\nSmall Tourmaline Deposit Small Topaz Deposit Small Sapphire Deposit Small Ruby Deposit Small Quartz Deposit Small Jade Deposit Small Amethyst Deposit Small Amber Deposit "},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/paths/shens-path-pack/","title":"Shen's Path Pack","body":"Includes:\nYellow brick path Wicker path Red brick path Rain rock path Marble path Leafy path Gravel path Crazy path Cracked mud path Cobble path Atlantis path Aratile path "},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/mods/zt2/objects/arches-canopies-and-fences/glass-fence/","title":"Glass Fence","body":"This is the an all glass fence created by Gibbon-Fanatic with help from Penguinman.

Try these out and see which works for you.\nTable of Contents Important Installing Entity Mods Lang Files Installing Zoos Installing Scenarios Questions? Important Turn off the game: Though it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cause any issues if we were to install a mod while your game is running, it makes sense to have it shut down so that any changes show up on a re-launch. Unzip your files: All files on ZooBerry are in .zip format and will require access to a zip utility. Below are resources that can get you started. Zipping/Unzipping files with the default Windows zip utility Zipping/Unzipping files with 7-Zip Download 7-Zip How to use 7-Zip Installing Entity Mods An entity in Zoo Tycoon can be described as any animal or object (buildings, foliage, etc). Installing custom entities in Zoo Tycoon 1 is easy and amounts to a simple drag and drop.\nFirst, go to the ZT1 root folder.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\\nIf you have a dlupdate folder, drop your .ztd file there:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\dlupdate\nIf you do not have a dlupdate folder, drop your .ztd file into the Updates folder instead:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Updates\nThe install directory changes depending on the version of the game you own but these instructions should be consistent.\nLang Files Importantly, Zoo Tycoon mods will often add new UI strings, things like guest thoughts, zoopedia entries, and other additions that require the inclusion of a .dll file in your installation process. This .dll file serves as a serialized data container with most of the strings in the game. Community nomenclature has dubbed these files \u0026rsquo;lang files\u0026rsquo; because they are always prefixed by the \u0026rsquo;lang\u0026rsquo; identifier.\nIf your mod requires a lang file, simply download the referenced version in the mod instruction blurb, extract the .dll file, and drop it into the root Zoo Tycoon game directory:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\\nNote: Not all ZT1 mods make use of lang files.\nInstalling Zoos .zoo files are the Zoo Tycoon 1 save file format and is used for both the zoo maps themselves after saving the game and for scenarios.\nTo install a zoo save file, drop it into the following directory:\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Saved Games\nInstalling Scenarios If you happen to have a copy of one of the few custom scenarios and wish to install it, simply drop the .zoo file in the following directory. Any accompanying .ztd and lang files are installed the same as explained above.\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Maps\nQuestions?

Place your extracted .z2f files in here:\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Zoo Tycoon 2\nMethod 2 Many legacy mods from ZooMania and the Zoo Tycoon 2 Design Centre contain .dl files alongside the main mod files. These files were usually included because they credited the mod author and allowed for the mod to appear as a \u0026lsquo;download\u0026rsquo; within Zoo Tycoon 2. This section is a bit more involved, but is still worth understanding if you wish to have the original mods set up the way they were originally meant to be seen. It is also a great method because it allows to organize your mods a bit more within subdirectories. See ahead for details.\nPlease note that this does require displaying hidden files on Windows, so if this is a non-negotiable option to you, feel free to stick to the above install method.\nStep 1 Folders are hidden on Windows by default. We need to make them visible to see the install directory.\nTo display hidden files and folders on Windows XP, Windows 7\nOpen Folder Options in Control Panel. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Click Appearance and Themes, and then click Folder Options. On the View tab, under Hidden files and folders, click Show hidden files and folders. To display hidden files and folders on modern Windows systems\nOpen a File Explorer window In the submenu up top, click on View \u0026gt; Show \u0026gt; Hidden Items Step 2 Drop your .dl files inside of the following directory:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon 2\\downloads\\zootycoon_com_zt2_1033\nThis directory should already be populated if you have official DLC installed.\nStep 3 Drop your .z2f files into any one of the folders denoted by a four-digit number.\nInstalling Zoos and Maps Zoos and maps are essentially save files and will go into the save folder. Open up a File Explorer on Windows and enter the following line into the address bar:\n%appdata%\nThis will convert into a proper file-system address that will have several folders named after applications installed on your computer. From here, go to the following path:\nMicrosoft Games \u0026gt; Zoo Tycoon 2 \u0026gt; Default Profile \u0026gt; Saved\nThis is where you will drop your .z2f save file.\nQuestions?

If you\u0026rsquo;re an author and wish to find out more about what license you might pick to submit to ZooBerry, please read ahead.\nZoo Tycoon Public Domain The Zoo Tycoon community has established a voluntary licensing mechanism that allows creators to choose whether their mod will be released under public domain or not. In the context of the Zoo Tycoon modding scene, being public domain means that an author\u0026rsquo;s coding, models, meshes, skins, and animations can be used to create new content, as long as credit is given to the original creator.\nSource: https://zt2downloadlibrary.fandom.com/wiki/Public_Domain\nWhile I do not enforce specific terms, I encourage authors to explore other open-source licenses that may provide more flexibility for their needs and offer clarity to both them and their users. Below are some resources that can assist in selecting such licenses.\nOther Licenses MIT License If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure about which license to choose and are interested in free and open-source options, you might want to consider the MIT license. For a comprehensive rundown of the MIT license, you can visit this resource: MIT License Rundown To access a copy of the MIT license that you can use for your own project (remember to customize the relevant sections), click here: MIT License Copy Other Open Source Licenses Please take the time to visit https://choosealicense.com/. It is designed specifically for someone who wishes to publish their work with a certain framework in mind and can help you get there quickly.\nQ\u0026amp;A Why use an open source license? There are numerous well-established licenses available. If you\u0026rsquo;re eager to share your work freely and encourage derivative works, it may be worth considering the benefits of protecting your hard work within the boundaries you wish to establish, even within the open-source community.\nWhat if you don\u0026rsquo;t pick a license? That\u0026rsquo;s okay! If you don\u0026rsquo;t choose a license, your work is automatically protected by copyright law and remains yours. However, not declaring a license implies that your work is not open source and not available for derivative works. Some of the legacy mods on ZooBerry were released before modders started specifying licenses, resulting in these works remaining closed. On that note, if I mislabeled a mod as closed and it is in fact open, please let me know!\nIn Summary When choosing an open source license, remember that you are making a commitment to allow the public to use, modify, and distribute your work. It is essential to understand your chosen terms to avoid any potential miscommunication with your users.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/about/","title":"About","body":"Welcome to ZooBerry Table of Contents Welcome to ZooBerry Hi, Welcome. ZooBerry Will you backup legacy mods from other forums not from ZooMania, Northern Skies, or Artifex? I\u0026rsquo;m a current Zoo Tycoon modder. May I submit files to ZooBerry for hosting? Mod ownership Community Hi, Welcome. My name is Goosifer, but I used to go by other usernames. A long time ago I used to help run a couple of Zoo Tycoon websites named ZooMania and Northern Skies. I was also lucky to join a modding team named Artifex toward the very end of my time in the scene. Though I was incredibly young and still in high school, I consider it one of the coolest experiences and was able to learn a lot of fun tech while I explored my creative outlet online. In fact I think that Zoo Tycoon was a huge influence behind my decision to eventually study computer science.\nZooBerry ZooBerry is a recent idea and more or less came around when I \u0026rsquo;re-joined\u0026rsquo; the ZT modding scene some time in April 2023. I realized that all of the cool mods that my friends put together back in the day were no longer available anywhere. ZooMania never moved to Tapatalk and Northern Skies is slowly losing some of its files hosted through MediaFire and the like. I had a hand in running these websites back in the day and in Artifex\u0026rsquo;s case, was a freshman member of the team. I guess you can say I have a little stake in keeping them around a little longer.\nZooBerry was designed from the ground-up for Zoo Tycoon enthusiasts. Though it is in a usable state, many improvements are coming and I always welcome suggestions for new features.\nWill you backup legacy mods from other forums not from ZooMania, Northern Skies, or Artifex? As of November 2023, the scope of this project has grown from archiving mods from three websites, to nine. If you ran a Zoo Tycoon website or are a modder who wants their mods archived, please feel free to contact us. We are always open to adding additional libraries to the archive.\nThe current list of websites whose mods we are committed to hosting are as follows:\nZooMania Northern Skies Artifex ZT2 Designing Centre Penguika Penguin\u0026rsquo;s Peak Shen\u0026rsquo;s Den Zoo Tycoon Hideout Zoo Tycoon Volcano Mods from these websites are hosted with permission from the following website owners/responsible parties:\nPenguinman (Co-Founder, Team Member, Co-Owner): ZT2 Designing Centre, Artifex, Penguika, Penguin\u0026rsquo;s Peak ShenTirag (Owner, Team Member): Shen\u0026rsquo;s Den, Artifex Koala Komander (Founder, Co-Owner, Team Member): ZooMania, Artifex Goosifer (Team Member, Co-Owner, Co-Founder): ZooMania, Northern Skies, Artifex Incinerox (Owner): Zoo Tycoon Volcano JohnZTMaster (Owner, Founder, Co-Owner): Zoo Tycoon Hideout, ZT2 Designing Centre Note: roles in parantheses are not in any particular order.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a current Zoo Tycoon modder. May I submit files to ZooBerry for hosting? Absolutely. Although mod archival is the main motivation behind ZooBerry\u0026rsquo;s creation, I\u0026rsquo;d love for it to become a platform for current mods as well. Please check out the contact page for more information.\nMod ownership The original authors for mods hosted on ZooBerry have long moved on and are no longer in the Zoo Tycoon modding community. Whenever possible we have made effort to contact modders that are still around for permission to host their libraries, but when not available we contact the website owner that hosts their mods for permission to take over stewardship if the owner thinks it makes sense. (i.e. if file links are starting to break)\nZooBerry believes in mod ownership and therefore if you are author to a mod hosted here on ZooBerry and wish to have it taken down, please message us at zooberry@goosifer.io.\nCommunity ZooBerry has a forum component here: https://forums.zooberry.org/. It is mostly used to communicate website updates and to keep an open line of communication for anyone that has any questions about mods hosted on ZooBerry.\nFor other ZT forum communities around the internet, please see the links page.\n"},{"href":"https://www.zooberry.org/search/","title":"Search","body":"Search guide Use * asterisks before or after words to expand results.\nDo not use the asterisks if looking for exact words.\nSay we want to find anything with the word Ginger Simply search Ginger without asterisk if looking for Ginger Ging* will find Ginger or other words that start with Ging Ginger* won\u0026rsquo;t work.
