MaxGuestsBase is the guest limit for a half-star zoo; MaxGuestsPerStar is the increase to the guest limit for each star (half stars count half) in addition to that half star. In other words:\nL = b + p(s - .5)\nwhere L = guest limit, b = MaxGuestsBase, p = MaxGuestsPerStar, s = number of stars of fame in the zoo.\nThe default settings are MaxGuestsBase = 30 and MaxGuestsPerStar = 20, yielding a limit of 120 guests for a five-star zoo.\n"

Try these out and see which works for you.\nTable of Contents Important Installing Entity Mods Lang Files Installing Zoos Installing Scenarios Questions? Important Turn off the game: Though it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cause any issues if we were to install a mod while your game is running, it makes sense to have it shut down so that any changes show up on a re-launch. Unzip your files: All files on ZooBerry are in .zip format and will require access to a zip utility. Below are resources that can get you started. Zipping/Unzipping files with the default Windows zip utility Zipping/Unzipping files with 7-Zip Download 7-Zip How to use 7-Zip Installing Entity Mods An entity in Zoo Tycoon can be described as any animal or object (buildings, foliage, etc). Installing custom entities in Zoo Tycoon 1 is easy and amounts to a simple drag and drop.\nFirst, go to the ZT1 root folder.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\\nIf you have a dlupdate folder, drop your .ztd file there:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\dlupdate\nIf you do not have a dlupdate folder, drop your .ztd file into the Updates folder instead:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Updates\nThe install directory changes depending on the version of the game you own but these instructions should be consistent.\nLang Files Importantly, Zoo Tycoon mods will often add new UI strings, things like guest thoughts, zoopedia entries, and other additions that require the inclusion of a .dll file in your installation process. This .dll file serves as a serialized data container with most of the strings in the game. Community nomenclature has dubbed these files \u0026rsquo;lang files\u0026rsquo; because they are always prefixed by the \u0026rsquo;lang\u0026rsquo; identifier.\nIf your mod requires a lang file, simply download the referenced version in the mod instruction blurb, extract the .dll file, and drop it into the root Zoo Tycoon game directory:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\\nNote: Not all ZT1 mods make use of lang files.\nInstalling Zoos .zoo files are the Zoo Tycoon 1 save file format and is used for both the zoo maps themselves after saving the game and for scenarios.\nTo install a zoo save file, drop it into the following directory:\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Saved Games\nInstalling Scenarios If you happen to have a copy of one of the few custom scenarios and wish to install it, simply drop the .zoo file in the following directory. Any accompanying .ztd and lang files are installed the same as explained above.\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon\\Maps\nQuestions? ZooBerry doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a discussion community of its own. Please visit the links page for other Zoo Tycoon websites that can help with installation problems or shoot me an email if you would like to report a bug. See the contact page for more info.\n"

Zipping/Unzipping files with the default Windows zip utility Zipping/Unzipping files with 7-Zip Download 7-Zip How to use 7-Zip Method 1 Method 1 is the easiest way to install mods and amounts to a simple drag and drop. Place your extracted .z2f files in here:\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games/Zoo Tycoon 2\nMethod 2 Many legacy mods from ZooMania and the Zoo Tycoon 2 Design Centre contain .dl files alongside the main mod files. These files were usually included because they credited the mod author and allowed for the mod to appear as a \u0026lsquo;download\u0026rsquo; within Zoo Tycoon 2. This section is a bit more involved, but is still worth understanding if you wish to have the original mods set up the way they were originally meant to be seen. It is also a great method because it allows to organize your mods a bit more within subdirectories. See ahead for details.\nPlease note that this does require displaying hidden files on Windows, so if this is a non-negotiable option to you, feel free to stick to the above install method.\nStep 1 Folders are hidden on Windows by default. We need to make them visible to see the install directory.\nTo display hidden files and folders on Windows XP, Windows 7\nOpen Folder Options in Control Panel. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. Click Appearance and Themes, and then click Folder Options. On the View tab, under Hidden files and folders, click Show hidden files and folders. To display hidden files and folders on modern Windows systems\nOpen a File Explorer window In the submenu up top, click on View \u0026gt; Show \u0026gt; Hidden Items Step 2 Drop your .dl files inside of the following directory:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Microsoft Games\\Zoo Tycoon 2\\downloads\\zootycoon_com_zt2_1033\nThis directory should already be populated if you have official DLC installed.\nStep 3 Drop your .z2f files into any one of the folders denoted by a four-digit number.\nInstalling Zoos and Maps Zoos and maps are essentially save files and will go into the save folder. Open up a File Explorer on Windows and enter the following line into the address bar:\n%appdata%\nThis will convert into a proper file-system address that will have several folders named after applications installed on your computer. From here, go to the following path:\nMicrosoft Games \u0026gt; Zoo Tycoon 2 \u0026gt; Default Profile \u0026gt; Saved\nThis is where you will drop your .z2f save file.\nQuestions?

Many authors do choose to release their work under an open source license, even one as open as public domain. If you\u0026rsquo;re an author and wish to find out more about what license you might pick to submit to ZooBerry, please read ahead.\nZoo Tycoon Public Domain The Zoo Tycoon community has established a voluntary licensing mechanism that allows creators to choose whether their mod will be released under public domain or not. In the context of the Zoo Tycoon modding scene, being public domain means that an author\u0026rsquo;s coding, models, meshes, skins, and animations can be used to create new content, as long as credit is given to the original creator.\nSource: https://zt2downloadlibrary.fandom.com/wiki/Public_Domain\nWhile I do not enforce specific terms, I encourage authors to explore other open-source licenses that may provide more flexibility for their needs and offer clarity to both them and their users. Below are some resources that can assist in selecting such licenses.\nOther Licenses MIT License If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure about which license to choose and are interested in free and open-source options, you might want to consider the MIT license. For a comprehensive rundown of the MIT license, you can visit this resource: MIT License Rundown To access a copy of the MIT license that you can use for your own project (remember to customize the relevant sections), click here: MIT License Copy Other Open Source Licenses Please take the time to visit https://choosealicense.com/. It is designed specifically for someone who wishes to publish their work with a certain framework in mind and can help you get there quickly.\nQ\u0026amp;A Why use an open source license? There are numerous well-established licenses available. If you\u0026rsquo;re eager to share your work freely and encourage derivative works, it may be worth considering the benefits of protecting your hard work within the boundaries you wish to establish, even within the open-source community.\nWhat if you don\u0026rsquo;t pick a license? That\u0026rsquo;s okay! If you don\u0026rsquo;t choose a license, your work is automatically protected by copyright law and remains yours. However, not declaring a license implies that your work is not open source and not available for derivative works. Some of the legacy mods on ZooBerry were released before modders started specifying licenses, resulting in these works remaining closed. On that note, if I mislabeled a mod as closed and it is in fact open, please let me know!\nIn Summary When choosing an open source license, remember that you are making a commitment to allow the public to use, modify, and distribute your work. It is essential to understand your chosen terms to avoid any potential miscommunication with your users.\n"

    "title": "About",
    "body": "Welcome to ZooBerry Table of Contents Welcome to ZooBerry Hi, Welcome. ZooBerry Will you backup legacy mods from other forums not from ZooMania, Northern Skies, or Artifex? What about new mods released today? Mod ownership Community Hi, Welcome. My name is Goosifer, but I used to go by other usernames. A long time ago I used to help run a couple of Zoo Tycoon websites named ZooMania and Northern Skies. I was also lucky to join a modding team named Artifex toward the very end of my time in the scene. Though I was incredibly young and still in high school, I consider it one of the coolest experiences and was able to learn a lot of fun tech while I explored my creative outlet online. In fact I think that Zoo Tycoon was a huge influence behind my decision to eventually study computer science :P.\nZooBerry ZooBerry is a recent idea and more or less came around when I \u0026rsquo;re-joined\u0026rsquo; the ZT modding scene some time in April 2023. I realized that all of the cool mods that my friends put together back in the day were no longer available anywhere. ZooMania never moved to Tapatalk and Northern Skies is slowly losing some of its files hosted through MediaFire and the like. I had a hand in running these websites back in the day and in Artifex\u0026rsquo;s case, was a freshman member of the team. I guess you can say I have a little stake in keeping them around a little longer. :)\nZooBerry was designed from the ground-up for Zoo Tycoon enthusiasts. Though it is in a usable state, many improvements are coming and I always welcome suggestions for new features.\nWill you backup legacy mods from other forums not from ZooMania, Northern Skies, or Artifex? I need to see what my baseline hosting costs will be after a few months of running ZooBerry. If all looks good and reasonable, I might consider backing up other forums as long as I have permission from an admin in charge. I would also need them to express interest first. For the moment, I will have to respectfully decline until I can see where things go. That said, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested, feel free to reach out to me on Discord or at zooberry@goosifer.io and I can keep you posted if things change!\nWhat about new mods released today? If you\u0026rsquo;re a designer and wish to host your new mod on ZooBerry today, I would be happy to do so. This is agreeable versus full website backups since I can say I\u0026rsquo;m not committing to 300 files at a time. Please check out the contact page for more information.\nMod ownership ZooBerry believes in mod ownership and therefore if you are author to a mod hosted here on ZooBerry and wish to have it taken down, please do not hesitate to message me at zooberry@goosifer.io.\nCommunity ZooBerry has a forum component here: https://forums.zooberry.org/. We are the new kid on the block so activity is still getting there, but you\u0026rsquo;ll see some mod work being shared.\nFor other ZT forum communities around the internet, please see the links page.\n"
