# ZooBerry

ZooBerry is a mod-hosting repository dedicated to preserving and archiving mods for the Zoo Tycoon modding community, with permission obtained from original website owners or modders themselves. As the modding scene evolves, legacy mods hosted on platforms such as MegaUpload, Mediafire, and Savefile risk becoming inaccessible due to broken links. With over 20 years since the game's initial release, ZooBerry serves as a centralized platform to ensure the longevity of these valuable resources.

This website is statically generated using GoHugo templating code. The content presented in this repository represents the compiled code deployed during website updates.
