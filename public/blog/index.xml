With news that ZooAdmin might be making its exit, Yellowrose has asked ZooTek to rehome its content. Our website is luckily in a healthy position to help mitigate the space required for these downloads, so I happily agreed to at least help with the ZT2 files while Tek and the Download Database took care of the ZT1 files.</description></item><item><title>October 2024 - Mod Backup Summary</title><link>https://www.zooberry.org/blog/mbs-oct-24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 00:05:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.zooberry.org/blog/mbs-oct-24/</guid><description>Not a very productive month in terms of archiving but this is mostly because focus was mostly on releasing ZooBery 2.0 and well, I&amp;rsquo;m getting hit by midterms at uni.
