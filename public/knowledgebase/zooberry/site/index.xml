      <description>About ZooBerry Hi, Welcome. My name is Goosifer, but I used to go by other usernames. A long time ago I used to help run a couple of Zoo Tycoon websites named ZooMania and Northern Skies. I was also lucky to join a modding team named Artifex toward the very end of my time in the scene. Though I was incredibly young and still in high school, I consider it one of the coolest experiences and was able to learn a lot of fun tech while I explored my creative outlet online.</description>
