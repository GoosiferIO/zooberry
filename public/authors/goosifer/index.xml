We also received a few new releases for Zoo Tycoon 1, contributed by Serpyderpy, Buffzoo, and myself (Goosifer). The total number of mods archived this month is 168.
Looking ahead, here is our archive queue for February:

My name is Goosifer, but I used to go by other usernames. A long time ago I used to help run a couple of Zoo Tycoon websites named ZooMania and Northern Skies. I was also lucky to join a modding team named Artifex toward the very end of my time in the scene. Though I was incredibly young and still in high school, I consider it one of the coolest experiences and was able to learn a lot of fun tech while I explored my creative outlet online.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://www.zooberry.org/knowledgebase/zooberry/site/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.zooberry.org/knowledgebase/zooberry/site/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions What websites are being archived by ZooBerry? Originally the scope was just three websites, including ZooMania, Northern Skies, and Artifex. However, we had the privelege of getting permission to host mods from other websites as well.
The current list of websites whose mods and tutorials we are committed to archiving are as follows:
ZooMania Northern Skies Artifex ZT2 Designing Centre Penguika Penguin&amp;rsquo;s Peak Shen&amp;rsquo;s Den Zoo Tycoon Hideout Zoo Tycoon Volcano Z-Studio Bunyupy&amp;rsquo;s Projects Hispa Designs Dannybob&amp;rsquo;s Forum Stalker&amp;rsquo;s Ranch ZooTek Phoenix (Zoo Tycoon 2 Library) Zoo Admin (Zoo Tycoon 2 Library) How did you get permission to host mods from these websites?</description></item><item><title>How to Install Mods</title><link>https://www.zooberry.org/knowledgebase/zooberry/using-zooberry/how-to-install-mods/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.zooberry.org/knowledgebase/zooberry/using-zooberry/how-to-install-mods/</guid><description>How to Install Mods Important Turn off the game Though it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t cause any issues if we were to install a mod while your game is running, it makes sense to have it shut down so that any changes show up on a re-launch.
Unzip your files All files on ZooBerry are in .zip format and will require access to a zip utility.

The ZT2 Roundtable As the name suggests, this community is more geared toward fans of the Zoo Tycoon sequel. Still, it has one of the largest communities for the game still around.
