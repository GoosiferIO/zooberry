<h1>About</h1>
<h1 id="welcome-to-the-zooberry">Welcome to the ZooBerry</h1>
<h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2>
<p>My name is Goosifer out in the &rsquo;nets, but you may call me Eric. Back in the day I used to run Zoomania and Northern Skies, and was also a freshman member of the Artifex modding team (you may try your best to guess which one, I wasn&rsquo;t very prolific :P). Each of these websites had their own storied histories and ultimately each came down to a team effort to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>I was only a kid when I ran these websites and made mods for people to download. I didn&rsquo;t quite have any sysadmin experience let alone a job that allowed me to keep them going. I still tried, but eventually I had to call it quits. Real life took over.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-these-downloads-come-from">Where do these downloads come from?</h2>
<p>I returned to the Zoo Tycoon modding community recently and it&rsquo;s sad that it&rsquo;s no longer as active as it used to be, but it make sense. The original two games are about 20 years old! Which surprised me to see that most of the Mediafire links I used to host Zoomania downloads were still up. Still, we lost quite a few files.</p>
<p>The purpose behind this website is to conserve these downloads before more are lost. At the moment, this website is a trial run. Hosting files does cost money, so it&rsquo;s all dependant on how much I&rsquo;m able to handle. If you&rsquo;re so inclined as to donate to keep the lights on and would like to keep this project alive, I have a donation link at the top.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>*At least in the beginning, this website will be a trial run and will only host mods from Zoomania, Northern Skies, and Artifex. Those are websites I used to run so implicitly I can at least say I had permission in the past to host those files. However, please know that if you are an author and wish to have your mod removed from this database, I am more than happy to oblige.</p>
<h2 id="future-mods">Future Mods</h2>
<p>You might see new releases from time to time, but until I can establish a baseline for hosting costs, I will not accept new files at this time. If this changes, I will surely announce an update at any platforms where I might advertise regularly.</p>
