ZooBerry Beta v0.2.2
- Can now sort mods by author
 - It's in an early state but will be improved
- Can now click on an author's name and get a list of all mods they have worked on
- Readability improved on some buttons
- Changed the name of the button in a file listing from 'Download' to 'Details' because 'Download' didn't take you straight to the file on this page. (Thanks for the feedback, @Gymnasiast!)
- Visit the ZooBerry trello track ZooBerry progress

Near-future update:
- A dedicated domain has been purchased. ZooBerry.org will be its new home :)
- Discussed it with the EMU team and we decided we will be integrating a forum into ZooBerry. Similar to the design centre from long ago, it will be project-centric (and also meant as a platform to support our team projects: EMU, ZooBerry, <unannounced>, <unannounced>.
